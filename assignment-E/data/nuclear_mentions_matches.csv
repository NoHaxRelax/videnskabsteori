8,"We, Kärnfull, believe that nuclear power is a far better alternative to the Bornholm Energy Island project, which would cost Danish taxpayers at least 31.5 billion DKK in state subsidies, as estimated by the Danish Energy Agency. This is equivalent to three times the annual budget for the police. 

In contrast, nuclear power projects require no state subsidies. Kärnfull is prepared to build nuclear power plants in Denmark without any financial support from the state. The Energy Island project on Bornholm does not make economic sense, as confirmed by the analysis firm Kraka. Their senior economist, Frederik Læssøe Nielsen, has publicly challenged proponents to provide a single convincing argument for its construction. 

The challenges with the Energy Island project include:

1. **Massive state subsidies** of at least 31.5 billion DKK.  
2. **No contribution to energy security**, as additional wind turbines in the Baltic Sea will not solve this issue.  
3. **Extremely expensive Power-to-X (PtX) production** on Bornholm compared to alternative energy sources.  

Nuclear power, unlike these costly energy islands, can provide affordable and stable electricity and hydrogen production. By situating nuclear power plants at existing combined heat and power plants, we can avoid further industrializing natural areas.

Kärnfull Next is already developing nuclear power projects in Sweden and has expressed interest in doing so in Denmark if the current ban on nuclear power is lifted. Nuclear power eliminates the need for large-scale energy islands by offering stable electricity, district heating, and hydrogen production.

Furthermore, many of our customers have already saved thousands of kroner by switching to electricity contracts with 100% nuclear power, avoiding overpriced fixed-rate agreements or hidden fees.

191,"The failure of the Danish ""Energy Island"" projects is total. Denmark's energy and climate policy, which clings to wind power as the country's salvation, is exposed as deeply flawed. The largest tender ever for a domestic offshore wind farm, intended to build gigantic wind turbines in the North Sea to cover the energy consumption of over half of Denmark's population, has received no bids—none at all. Not even Ørsted, Denmark’s state-owned energy company, or private companies like Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners showed interest.

This fiasco reveals how the business model, which places all risks on bidders while demanding annual concession payments to the Danish state, is fundamentally unworkable. It also exposes the arrogance of Denmark's climate policy. The tender for nine gigawatts of offshore wind, with the first phase of three gigawatts approved by the Danish Parliament in May 2023, now appears to be collapsing.

Offshore wind farms are prohibitively expensive to build, and the current cost estimates far exceed previous projections. At the same time, Denmark and the rest of Europe face an overwhelming challenge: building affordable and reliable energy supplies, an issue that has become more urgent than meeting climate targets. This failed tender also has severe implications for other energy plans, including the two proposed ""Energy Islands"" in the North Sea and on Bornholm. The North Sea Energy Island has been postponed indefinitely due to high costs, and Energy Island Bornholm, which was already predicted to be unprofitable, must now also be considered financially untenable. The 8.7 billion kroner required for its construction was supposed to come from revenues from offshore wind in the North Sea.

It was a grave mistake to rely almost exclusively on offshore wind. It was unwise to embrace wind turbines with such blind faith while rejecting alternative solutions like nuclear power, which Denmark's Social Democrats have opposed for decades in pursuit of CO2-neutral energy. Now, everyone is left to suffer from the consequences of this failure, and we all know who will ultimately foot the bill for this debacle.",Mads Kastrup,Media outlet,Opinion editor,2024,2024-12-07,https://ekstrabladet.dk/nyheder/lederen/den-kolde-skulder/10460573,Ekstrabladet,National newspaper,Financial viability and (un)profitability,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,944.25,124.001953,7.465117,nuclear,Statement,-1

Poland will pay up to 20 billion USD or about 142 billion DKK for a plant that can produce 9 GW. But this production is stable, it doesn't care about wind, sun, water, etc., and it is also cheaper than huge wind islands.

This means we would destroy less nature, get it cheaper, and get more efficient electricity.

And speaking of timing, Poland's plant will start in 2026, with the first reactor finished and producing electricity in 2033, and all reactors completed in 2040.

If we can scale up to a capacity three times larger than currently envisioned, and if wind turbines are able to cover their own costs, it seems likely that we'll need to build many more energy-producing facilities.",Reddit user,General public opinion,,2023,2023-05-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denmark/comments/137vv71/comment/jivkzzb/,Reddit,Social media,(None),FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,1539.012695,654.710388,3.976744,nuclear,Statement,0
736,"But now that I think about it, everyone has known this was a bad investment for years. If you take the same 200 billion kroner and invest it in something like Hinkley Point C, which is the most expensive nuclear power plant, you could get 3.2 GW of capacity compared to the energy parks' 3 GW (with wind and ""hocus pocus"" technology) that would eventually reach 10 GW.

So, you're choosing between having 90-95% uptime with stable electricity and heat, or wind turbines with 50-65% uptime where most of that time is spent producing ash with only a 70% efficiency rate. The first option has a lifespan of 60-100 years, while the second one lasts only 20-30 years.

I'm not surprised anyone seriously thought energy parks would be cheaper. I've been saying this for around 10-12 years now, and even that doesn't come as a surprise when you consider the fact that there's still a rental income component to these projects, which is roughly equivalent to having the same initial investment cost",Reddit user,General public opinion,,2024,2024-10-09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denmark/comments/1fzl7ew/comment/lr4j6gr/,Reddit,Social media,(None),TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,1519.245239,564.098511,3,nuclear,Statement,1
737,"So now that batteries are on the way, the Energy Agency is expecting around 1 GW of storage capacity by 2030. Denmark already has around 16 GW of installed batteries, which translates to about 800 MWh in Denmark.

When you say ""maybe only a few weeks a year"", it's because those 'small holes' in the east are what we need to fill when we're recharging our VE-building capacity. The Climate Council analyzed supply security last year and concluded that in an ""intensive weather year"" we'll need to import electricity around 1000 times in 2030, equivalent to about 6 weeks.

How we fill those gaps is still a topic of discussion. It's likely going to be a combination of battery storage, flexibility on the demand side, flexible power plants, and imports. And yes, even though power plants will only need to run for around 100 hours a year, they'll still be needed. Take Kyndby Power Plant as an example, which is already standing by.

I'm surprised that people keep saying 'nuclear power would have been cheaper'. What experts in energy economics say, and what the market delivers are two different things. If business cases for nuclear power were really so good, I'd expect more countries to build them. Even China, which has all the prerequisites for cheap nuclear power, is building solar and wind 10 times faster.

As for when we'll have nuclear power in Denmark, if it's worth building, that's not going to be as soon as 10 years. We're talking more like 2040. It's not just about building a power plant; we need the right competencies, international agreements, and regulations before we can even start digging.

In Sweden, where they already have nuclear power, the government started working on new nuclear power in 2022 with plans to have it operational by 2035. In Norway, the Institute for Energy Technology estimates that you can get nuclear power as soon as 2040 if you start now.

There is no solution to the problem of what will back up wind and solar if we want a clean, climate-friendly energy grid. The current solution—and what will remain the solution—is fossil-fueled power plants, which, incidentally, emit more radioactive particles into the air than a nuclear power plant.  

The truth is that we don’t actually care about the environment or the climate in this country.

741,"Exporting electricity to other countries is clearly the obvious solution to managing surplus production. Additionally, building one facility at a time ensures we don't significantly overshoot future demand. Overproduction, however, might actually be beneficial, as it would make Denmark an attractive destination for energy-intensive businesses worldwide.  

By the time the first nuclear power plant is completed and operational in 20 years, almost all vehicles will run on electricity, making concerns about mismatched demand irrelevant.  

If we can afford expensive carbon capture facilities costing 10-20 billion DKK each and an energy island, those resources could be better spent on nuclear power first.  

Lack of expertise is never a valid excuse when dealing with new technology; we simply need to learn what we don’t know. It's not as complicated as it's made out to be. You should see the facilities currently operating across the country—the leap to nuclear is far smaller than it sounds.  

We are fully capable of managing safety ourselves. Nuclear facilities should be located near major cities where they would cause the least disruption to Danish nature and maximize energy efficiency.  

Cost overruns can be avoided by studying hundreds of completed reactor projects and applying the same methodologies we already use for large infrastructure projects.  

Bad companies bidding on projects can’t be entirely avoided, but we can set precise criteria, including a track record of successful reactor constructions, to ensure quality.  

If you're unwilling to take responsibility for your energy consumption, you're free to move to another EU country. Nuclear power is exceptionally safe and far less polluting than any other available fuels, making concerns about its use both unethical and misplaced. You should be more concerned about living near current facilities than future nuclear plants.  

Switching to nuclear would allow us to eliminate fossil fuel burning, except for waste, which is partially fossil-based.  

Wind turbines and solar panels rarely generate electricity when we need it most, requiring a massive overproduction of power. Heat would then have to be generated using electric boilers and heat pumps, incurring significant energy losses at each conversion stage. If we pursue that path, we’ll have to wait and hope for drastic price reductions in solar panels, which are currently falling significantly in cost. However, relying on that is a gamble, unlike nuclear power.  

Solar and wind energy cannot significantly improve their efficiency—they are already close to maximum potential. While they might become much cheaper over time, this remains uncertain.

742,"There is indeed a transitional period, during which we would either buy electricity from abroad (as we already do today—see the link below) or invest in a few biomass plants combined with as few solar panels as possible to minimize pollution of our natural environment.  

There would undoubtedly be resistance, but this is a hypothetical scenario in which the most strategically optimal plan is successfully implemented. Nuclear power is the least dangerous energy source we know, making it the right solution to place near major cities—even if, unfortunately, people today are hopelessly misinformed by the very politicians who influence these decisions.  

It’s true that there’s little room for improvement in the energy efficiency of solar panels and wind turbines; they are already extremely close to their hypothetical maximum efficiency. That’s a fact we must accept. I don’t know where you might have been told otherwise, but sadly, that’s the reality. I also wish there were more energy in the sun’s rays, but it is what it is. While the price of solar panels is already low from a historical perspective, it’s hard to imagine that it will drop tenfold to make overproduction a viable solution to meet all of our energy needs.  

Wind turbines are no longer decreasing in price either, so we can already rule them out as a solution to cover all our energy consumption. Meeting the demand would require so many wind turbines that their maximum output would be ten times our peak consumption, making them extremely expensive.  

Yes, there is always some wind, just not enough. Wind production fluctuates significantly. Check for yourself: \url{https://energinet.dk/energisystem_fullscreen/}. Look at the historical data, for instance, from October 4, 2024, and then October 7, 2024. You’ll see a factor of ten difference in production, even though the turbines are already spread across all viable locations.

Nuclear energy, particularly in the form of small modular reactors (SMRs), offers potential for district heating, but such reactors would need to be located close to urban areas to be effective. The development of smaller, mass-produced nuclear power plants by companies like Westinghouse and Radiant Industries is a promising path. These small reactors are designed to be simple, reliable, and almost passive in operation, which minimizes risks and allows for continuous design improvements in case of issues. Pilot projects in smaller towns would be a sensible first step to reduce Denmark's reliance on gas, eventually replacing natural gas with greener alternatives like biogas.

Currently, the push to green district heating is focused on solar, geothermal energy, and reducing district heating temperatures. Additionally, the focus should shift away from reliance on natural gas companies, which generate significant amounts of non-green energy and profit from it.

854,"THE COLD SHOWER  

The FAILURE seems total. Denmark’s energy and climate policy, clinging to wind as the country’s savior, is now exposed like a winter swimmer regretting halfway down the pier.  

The largest tender ever for a domestic offshore wind farm, involving the construction of giant turbines in the North Sea to supply energy equivalent to the consumption of more than half of Denmark’s population, has received zero bids. None. Not even from the state-owned company Ørsted.  

Nor from energy profiteers like Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners.  

THIS REVEALS not just how flawed the business model is—with all risks placed on the bidder and the demand for annual concession payments to the Danish state—but also the self-righteous face of Danish climate policy.  

The tender for building nine gigawatts of offshore wind—three gigawatts in the first round—was approved by Parliament in May 2023. But the politicians’ one-sided reliance on wind power is now losing momentum.  

OFFSHORE WIND FARMS are outrageously expensive to construct. None of the earlier price estimates come close to reflecting the actual costs that are now evident.  

Meanwhile, Denmark—and Europe as a whole—faces an overwhelming problem: building cheap and reliable energy. This issue is becoming more urgent than meeting climate targets.  

The failed tender has, of course, significant consequences for other related energy plans. Until recently, politicians also planned two 'energy islands'—one in the North Sea and one on Bornholm. These were meant to convert wind into electricity, providing green power to 13.3 million European households.  

The North Sea energy island has been postponed indefinitely. It’s too expensive.  

And if 'Energy Island Bornholm' wasn’t already predicted to be unprofitable, it must be now. The 8.7 billion kroner for its construction was supposed to come from revenues generated by wind farms in the North Sea.  

IT WAS NOT WISE to bet almost everything on offshore wind. It has been foolish to adhere so religiously to wind turbines while rejecting alternatives like nuclear power, as the Social Democrats have done for decades in pursuit of CO2-neutral energy.

869,"While researchers may calculate that it is theoretically possible to base energy supply on wind and solar power, I believe it is not desirable for several reasons.

First, there will inevitably be numerous challenges in translating theory into practice, leading to delays in the energy transition and prolonged dependence on fossil fuels.

Second, Power-to-X technology is not yet mature, and there are no facilities currently capable of delivering the scale of energy needed to power an entire country. Politicians are gambling on the rapid development of this technology, but there is no guarantee it will be ready when needed. Additionally, storing and transporting large quantities of energy for periods with no wind or solar power—such as calm, foggy weeks in January—presents significant logistical challenges.

The North Sea Energy Island is projected to cost 210 billion kroner, providing an installed capacity of 3 GW of wind turbines, with an actual average output of 1.5 GW due to a capacity factor of 50%. This must cover electricity consumption, Power-to-X needs, and electrified district heating. The Energy Island is not expected to be operational until 2033. By comparison, Poland has agreed to purchase six APR 1400 nuclear reactors from South Korea’s Kepco for 202 billion kroner, providing 8.4 GW installed capacity and 7.98 GW effective output due to a 95% capacity factor. The first reactor is expected to deliver electricity to the Polish grid by 2030. Nuclear power can also provide district heating, reducing the need for additional electricity. Given Denmark’s energy needs of 4–5 GW, the Polish model would offer surplus capacity for exports, synthetic fuels, or cost savings by building fewer reactors.

A wind- and solar-powered grid would require substantial technological solutions, such as using electric vehicle batteries to buffer fluctuations. A stable supply from nuclear power would eliminate the need for these costly and unnecessary innovations, reduce wear on expensive batteries, and avoid changing consumption habits—arguably one of the most challenging tasks.

It has been documented that wind power requires more than twice the resources (concrete, steel, copper, etc.) to deliver the same amount of energy as nuclear power.

Denmark currently imports hydropower from Norway during shortages, but Norway has faced decreasing rainfall in recent years, limiting its ability to export electricity. Norwegian energy officials have also stated that Norway neither can nor wishes to serve as a buffer for Northern Europe. Even Norway is debating nuclear power due to doubts about the long-term reliability of hydropower.

In summary, while it might be theoretically possible to rely on wind and solar power, I do not believe there is sufficient time to develop, build, and implement the necessary solutions or to change consumption habits. This approach risks prolonging our reliance on fossil fuels such as coal or deforestation-based biomass.",Journalist,Zetland,,2023,2023-01-08,https://www.zetland.dk/historie/sOLEkWJa-ae6XddK5-c5c74,Zetland,National newspaper,(None),FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,1360.455322,908.010376,5.093023,nuclear;reactor,Statement,1
879,"Here are my concerns about the Energy Island projects, though much remains unknown:

1. The plan to install 12 GW of additional wind turbines to supply electricity to neighboring countries is fundamentally flawed. Neighboring countries also have surpluses of wind-generated electricity at the same time as Denmark, which means we will often struggle to export this electricity. This issue already exists today.

2. Wind turbines only generate electricity when the wind blows. For approximately 40-60 days per year, other energy sources will need to cover the electricity demand. Current information does not explain where this electricity will come from during calm weather.

3. A portion of the surplus electricity is intended for Power-to-X (PtX) production, such as fuel for aviation. PtX requires both hydrogen (H) and carbon (C). Hydrogen can come from wind-powered electricity, but the source of carbon is unclear. Will it come from CO2 captured at power plants in Zealand or Jutland—plants that political parties simultaneously demand to shut down? The other Energy Island will presumably also require CO2 from Zealand.

4. In addition to the estimated costs of 38 billion kroner and 210 billion kroner for the Energy Island projects, further investments will be needed for wind turbines, PtX facilities, pipelines, and long underwater power cables. This could add another 100 billion kroner, though the exact amount is unknown.

5. Assuming these cost estimates are accurate, the total expense would be around 300 billion kroner, which equates to 50,000 kroner per Dane, including infants, or 200,000 kroner per average household.

6. Although some of the investment is expected to come from private funds, this does not change the fact that the projects place a significant financial burden on society. This money could be used for initiatives with more certain benefits.

7. The costs of wind power, along with the additional required investments, are now so high that Denmark could instead build 4-5 nuclear power plants. These nuclear plants would provide reliable electricity regardless of wind conditions, without the need for energy islands. They would meet all Danish and EU climate requirements for the next 50-60 years, whereas offshore wind turbines typically last only 20-25 years.

I suspect that most members of Parliament who approved these projects have very little understanding of these issues.

968,"The idea behind Power-to-X (PtX) technology is good, but its implementation is challenging. Firstly, these facilities are expensive to build and haven’t decreased in price like solar panels and wind turbines. 
However, it’s not just the cost of setup that’s an issue—there’s also significant energy loss. For example, using electricity directly in an electric vehicle yields up to 90% energy efficiency, compared to about 20% in a gasoline vehicle running on PtX fuel. Hydrogen vehicles perform better but still only reach around 30-40% efficiency. This means three times as many wind turbines are needed to power PtX-fueled vehicles compared to battery-powered alternatives.

Additionally, the technology needs further development to meet growing energy demands effectively.

For instance, Maersk has planned to use PtX fuels but struggles to meet its goals. They are also exploring biofuels and even considering nuclear power, which they previously ruled out.

981,"Despite the technical and, in some cases, niche commercial maturity of key technologies and some early on-ground deployment, we acknowledge that most renewable P2X products are still costlier compared to their conventional fossil-fuel-based production processes. This price variation likely arises due to the decentralized modes of P2X plants, with most P2X plants being small-scale, whereas traditional chemical and energy industries benefit from economies of scale and the ability to negotiate lower feedstock pricing. In addition, we recognize that most P2X technologies suffer from relatively high capital costs, which are projected to decline as manufacturers ramp up their production capacity, and they have large electricity requirements. There is growing consensus that the cost-competitiveness of P2X is heavily influenced by the availability of cheap and excess renewable electricity. That said, we remain optimistic about the evolving economics of these P2X technologies, which are promising and highlight the opportunity for commercial viability and scale-up. These economics are expected to improve further due to advances in catalyst and system development for both electrolysis and secondary conversion reactor systems across various P2X pathways.

In addition to capital costs and electricity pricing, we also believe that the costs of feedstock will play a crucial role in determining the price of P2X products. In particular, for several secondary conversion processes, renewable power-to-hydrogen and its associated economics will be pivotal for their feasibility.

In the following sections, we will present the outlook and challenges of different P2X technologies and discuss pathways for cost reductions.

Power-to-H2: While renewable hydrogen pricing is currently at least two times more expensive than hydrogen produced from fossil fuels, we see that declining electrolyzer capital costs, resulting from economies of scale, and the adoption of a new generation of cost-effective catalysts (either replacing commercial Pt/Ir catalysts or reducing their loading), alongside decreasing electricity prices, are driving competitive levelized costs across various jurisdictions. Although most research and demonstrations on renewable H2 have focused on using clean water, we also believe it is crucial to explore the use of wastewater and seawater as feedstock, especially in regions like Australia, North America, the Middle East, and China, where fresh water is scarce. The direct use of seawater presents challenges, such as electrode and membrane stability issues (due to impurities in seawater) and the formation of Cl2 instead of O2 during the anode reaction. Considerable research and funding are being directed toward developing stable systems that can directly use seawater or combine reverse osmosis water purification with electrolysis. In contrast, the use of wastewater for electrolysis is more mature, with a number of commercial systems capable of converting gray water to hydrogen. We expect that further research into the chemistry of these technologies will provide solutions to address water-related concerns in hydrogen production.","Rahman Daiyan, Iain MacGill and Rose Amal",,researchers,2020,2020-10-21,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenergylett.0c02249,ACS Publications,Research paper,(None),FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,-660.817871,1228.176025,3.139535,reactor,Statement,0

The energy islands solve multiple problems by creating a hub-and-spoke system. Instead of having scattered, individual wind farms providing small amounts of power to individual areas, these islands will serve as central collection and distribution hubs. By connecting different types of energy sources - solar, wind, hydroelectric, and nuclear - across Europe through these hubs, we can better balance the power grid without needing to store enormous amounts of wind energy.

1951,"Wind energy at sea is at its strongest, unaffected by land masses. The Energy Island has six large aerogenerators, three at a lower height (OMIT) to intercept the sea-hugging wind flow, while three are at greater heights to capture the upper wind flows. The hydraulic masts are able to adjust the heights of the aerogenerators to best harvest the wind potential from different directions.

Apart from its electricity contribution, the Energy Island is designed also to produce hydrogen. Because of the fluctuation of renewable energy resources, an energy storage system is required. The Energy Island relies on a hydrolysis plant to produce stored hydrogen and oxygen, part of which can be used by fuel cell technology as necessary to balance the power output for both external and internal uses. Part of the fuel can, in some cases, be tankered or pipelined to other destinations, when the electricity produced is not totally used by cable links to nearby destinations.

The Energy Island will also produce a base for Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) and Mariculture. In tropical latitudes, greenhouses need to be protected from the sun, a role performed by the heliostats, and well ventilated or evaporatively cooled. The 22-hectare platform can therefore be used for CEA, using part of the distilled water from the open OTEC cycle for hydroponics. If the floor is trellised, light can reach the seawater below, where pens would contain various forms of marine life.

Harbours and Housing: On the leeward side of the island or islands, the Energy Island needs to provide housing for staff, social facilities, workshops and harbours.

The Energy Island uses many diverse renewable energy sources, bringing their converted powers together in the most efficient way to provide electricity for the grid, and, by hydrolysis, hydrogen fuel for transport to nearby or distant population centers, where it can be used efficiently by fuel cell technology. The Energy Island can become a major supplier of electricity and hydrogen fuel for a pollution free society, and liberate the world from the perils of nuclear power generation, and from its political, economic and polluting dependence on dwindling fossil fuels.

The worst leak was in Chernobyl, where 200,000 people were evacuated, but 'only' 56 died, which is comparable to the number of coal miners who die in a day worldwide.

We are facing a future of excessively high electricity prices, supply shortages, and power outages. This must be averted with new nuclear power technology. In the coming decades, Danes' electricity consumption will only go in one direction – up. That’s a problem because there is no chance that the demand for all that electricity will be met under the current policies aimed at achieving green transition goals. One issue with ‘renewable’ energy facilities is that they only last 25 to 30 years – another is that they don’t produce electricity when it’s dark or windless. When the weather is sunny and windy, existing facilities already produce more electricity than Denmark currently needs. However, when the weather is less favorable, energy sources that can be controlled independently of weather conditions are required. The larger the role solar panels and wind turbines play in energy production, the more vulnerable and expensive the system becomes, as greater backup capacity is needed for those days when the weather doesn’t cooperate – like on cold, calm winter days when our heat pumps are running at full speed. The Danish power grid is connected to that of our neighboring countries, and today we import electricity to avoid power outages when the turbines are idle, and the solar panels lack sunlight. As more neighboring countries increase their investments in solar and wind energy, this will become far more difficult, perhaps even impossible.

3295,"What frustrates me the most is the constant omission of external costs associated with wind and solar energy. It's fine when small amounts of wind and solar energy are integrated into the market. However, as their share grows, other energy sources become more expensive. For instance, biogas plants can only operate profitably for 12 hours a day instead of 24 hours. There are also long-term storage costs to consider. With sufficient baseload power, only minimal energy storage is needed, such as with lithium-iron-phosphate batteries. If we calculate one kilowatt-hour of storage for 24 hours with a 20-year lifespan and a cost of €80 per kilowatt-hour, the storage cost per kilowatt of stochastic energy generation would be approximately 1.1 cents. This isn't noticeable under current electricity costs, especially when only a fraction of energy is generated stochastically. 

But what happens if, in the future, we rely almost entirely on wind and solar energy and need to store energy for 10 days? Storage costs could reach around 10 cents per kilowatt-hour, on top of the 3-8 cents for generation costs.

4054,"The Swedish engineering consultancy company Sweco is tasked with designing the world's first ""energy island,"" a groundbreaking project with the capacity to supply electricity to 10 million European households. This project, eight kilometers off the west coast of Jutland, represents a major leap forward in offshore wind power, following Denmark's pioneering efforts in 1991 as the first country to build an offshore wind farm. 

The energy island will act as a hub for thousands of offshore wind turbines, enabling electricity distribution across multiple countries. Initially spanning 15 hectares (approximately 30 football fields), the artificial island's construction cost is estimated at 290 billion Swedish kronor. The island is intended to support the green energy transition by providing 3-10 gigawatts of electricity, with the potential to scale up to 45 terawatt-hours annually, surpassing the output of Forsmark’s three nuclear reactors. It will serve Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands, ultimately expanding to cover an area equivalent to 64 football fields.

One of the key challenges lies in handling the North Sea's 25-meter waves, as the island will be constructed at sea level. Additionally, the project will employ power-to-x technology, which is critical for stabilizing wind power output. Surplus energy generated during high wind periods and low electricity demand can be converted into hydrogen or climate-neutral fuels for use in aviation, shipping, and heavy industry.

4269,"France has become Germany's largest electricity supplier in 2024, providing a net 13 TWh, due to France's lower production costs. While Germany has enough production capacity, German power plants have lost competitiveness since the nuclear phaseout. The European Union's electricity market operates on a lowest-cost principle, as confirmed by the Federal Net Agency - electricity is generated wherever it's cheapest.

This situation is politically sensitive because about 70% of French electricity comes from nuclear power. Germany hasn't truly abandoned nuclear energy - Germany is still using nuclear power indirectly through imports. This effectively acknowledges that existing nuclear reactors are weather-independent, low-CO2, and most importantly, an inexpensive power source - cheaper than coal and gas plants which face additional costs from increasingly expensive EU CO2 certificates.

France's 50+ nuclear reactors demonstrate their economic advantage especially during periods without wind and solar power (dark doldrums). During these times, nuclear production costs are unmatched. The French Energy Regulatory Authority CRE estimates medium-term costs at around six cents per kilowatt-hour, including all modernization costs, nuclear material disposal, waste management, and recycling. Even factoring in the expensive Flamanville 3 reactor's high production costs of up to twelve cents, as estimated by the French Court of Auditors, nuclear remains competitive.

The operational costs for French reactors are only three to four cents according to Nicolas Goldberg from Columbus Consulting Paris - less than half of Germany's 2024 wholesale electricity prices. This makes exports highly profitable for EDF, France's power plant operator, especially with France's current low domestic demand due to economic weakness.

Grid balancing costs have risen dramatically as subsidized, inflexible renewables have taken over electricity supply - from £367 million in 2002 to nearly £1.5 billion in 2019. Now, due to wind and solar's inability to respond to low demand during lockdown, National Grid expects costs to reach £2 billion, and this estimate assumes costs normalize after August.

The UK's renewable-based system is fragile and can barely handle normal operations - any unexpected situation causes a crisis. National Grid has been propping up this failing system with enormous amounts of consumer money. With £10 billion per year in subsidies and price-fixing for renewables, consumers are paying astronomical costs for an unreliable system. If demand stays low during a post-Covid recession, these multi-billion pound costs for managing and subsidizing renewables will need to be recovered from much smaller electricity sales volumes, leading to unprecedented price increases for British consumers.

4416,"I have proposed decision proposal B91 to the Danish Parliament, suggesting that the government establish a commission to investigate the potential use of nuclear power in Denmark’s energy supply.  

Denmark requires significant amounts of renewable energy from wind and solar, which Liberal Alliance fully supports. However, it is impossible to build a reliable energy system solely on wind and solar due to their inherent fluctuations. For example, a cloudy, windless Christmas Eve could leave households without adequate energy supply. As Denmark increases its reliance on wind and solar, these fluctuations will only become more pronounced, making it essential to balance the energy system.  

Currently, the plan is to store surplus energy generated on sunny and windy days using Power-to-X technology or various types of batteries and to utilize gas boilers when renewable energy production is low. While these stabilizing measures are important, there are alternative ways to create stable, green baseload energy. The goal must be an abundance of affordable green electricity.  

Nuclear power is an unavoidable component of Europe’s energy future. Many countries already use nuclear power, are expanding its use, or regret reducing their reliance on it. Denmark, however, actively prohibits nuclear power despite importing it from other countries.

However, if nuclear power were to be used for district heating, nuclear plants would need to be built relatively close to urban areas, meaning a high number of smaller nuclear power plants would be required across the country. There is ongoing development of small nuclear power plants by companies such as Westinghouse and Radiant Industries, with a focus on mass-producing small reactors.

This approach seems very advantageous because, even if an issue were to occur, it would be relatively easy to contain, and lessons could be learned to improve future designs. These plants already feature simple, highly reliable designs that are essentially passive. I believe these systems should be piloted in small towns as a first step, which would also help reduce the amount of gas used. This would make it easier to transition the remaining gas consumption to green alternatives like biogas. If we are to challenge any industries, it should likely be the natural gas companies, as they currently provide much of Denmark's non-green electricity and are highly profitable.

Currently, the shift towards greener district heating seems to be focused on solar, geothermal energy, and reducing district heating temperatures.

Friedrich Merz is the most likely chancellor after the election, and his view on wind power differs significantly from most Danish politicians. He prefers to focus on nuclear power instead. If Energy Island Bornholm is to be realized, it will likely be funded by Danish taxpayers. The Danish government has made a U-turn and is opening up for state subsidies for offshore wind. Initially, this will only cover new tenders for 2-3 gigawatts of offshore wind, while a large ongoing tender for areas in Denmark's internal waters is canceled.

7449,"STOP the renewable energy madness – the energy policy is a farce!

Danes are paying the highest electricity prices in the EU. Higher than Germany. Higher than France. Higher than any other country in the EU. And this is not a coincidence – it is a direct result of the government's catastrophic energy policy.

The government has pumped billions of taxpayer money into wind turbines and solar panels, but what have we received? Unstable energy, sky-high prices, and a food sector suffering under electricity bills that have spiraled out of control. When electricity fluctuates up and down like a rollercoaster at Tivoli, the bill is directly passed on to consumers and businesses. The result? More expensive food, more expensive goods, and higher inflation.

It is time to stop the expansion of renewable energy. The latest fiascos with the Energy Island Bornholm and the three failed tender rounds highlight that urgent action is needed.

The good news is that there is an alternative – nuclear power!

While the government insists on continuing its green puppet show, Dansk Folkeparti has long proposed a real solution: Let us try to buy the Brokdorf plant in northern Germany – one of the safest and most efficient nuclear power plants in Europe, which the Germans have decided to shut down, but which we could easily reopen and operate until fourth-generation nuclear power is ready.

Instead, Mette Frederiksen and Lars Løkke are pouring billions into projects that don’t work. They live in the illusion that we can close stable energy sources and replace them with solar and wind, which only work when the weather allows. This is not energy policy – it is an expensive and dangerous game with the economy and future of Denmark.

Let us be clear:
❌ STOP wasting taxpayer money on renewable energy!
❌ STOP the insane electricity prices that are ruining the Danish economy!
✅ START a serious push for nuclear power – the only solution that can ensure cheap, stable, and CO2-free energy for Denmark!
