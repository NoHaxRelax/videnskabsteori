The current approach to protecting the energy market is deeply flawed. If policies are designed to oppose nuclear energy in every way, it is clear that the market will not invest in it. The government controls the market, leaving it with no choice but to follow these political signals.

The UK electricity system is rapidly deteriorating because of renewable energy sources, as proven by the skyrocketing system balancing costs in recent weeks. The Bank Holiday weekend alone required £50 million in balancing costs, and National Grid projects an additional £700 million in costs from May to August. Grid balancing costs have risen dramatically as subsidized, inflexible renewables have taken over electricity supply - from £367 million in 2002 to nearly £1.5 billion in 2019. Now, due to wind and solar's inability to respond to low demand during lockdown, National Grid expects costs to reach £2 billion, and this estimate assumes costs normalize after August.

The UK's renewable-based system is fragile and can barely handle normal operations - any unexpected situation causes a crisis. National Grid has been propping up this failing system with enormous amounts of consumer money. With £10 billion per year in subsidies and price-fixing for renewables, consumers are paying astronomical costs for an unreliable system. If demand stays low during a post-Covid recession, these multi-billion pound costs for managing and subsidizing renewables will need to be recovered from much smaller electricity sales volumes, leading to unprecedented price increases for British consumers.

The national interest demands a cost minimization strategy based on gas and nuclear power. Consumers should start saving money now because they will need diesel generators to maintain reliable power supply. The UK government cannot be trusted to spend public money wisely on energy. The 'zerowits' who fell for this green fraud should be ashamed of putting so much at risk and wasting public money. Renewable energy has caused extensive damage at enormous cost with no benefit to consumers or the environment.

Nuclear used to be way cheaper than this amount. Costs are only going to continue to skyrocket if the United States is only going to sporadically construct new facilities. Sad.

The transition to renewable energy, including the Danish “Energy Island” projects, is a fraudulent hoax. The focus on biomass as a climate solution is deceitful and unacceptable. We should resist this fake transition with all possible effort. Nuclear power is a viable solution, but the politically correct elite refuses to acknowledge it. Under no circumstances should we accept any of these bio-based solutions within the realm of renewable energy.

The Danish 'Energy Island' projects are a waste of money and a publicity stunt. While the official completion date is set for 2028, reports indicate that an optimistic estimate is 2033, and engineers suggest it will likely be finished by 2035. The $25 billion budget allocated for the project should be redirected to nuclear power development. These artificial islands, marketed as eco-friendly, will inevitably exceed their budget and end up costing $50 billion, similar to other large-scale Danish projects.

Here are my concerns about the Energy Island projects, though much remains unknown:

1. The plan to install 12 GW of additional wind turbines to supply electricity to neighboring countries is fundamentally flawed. Neighboring countries also have surpluses of wind-generated electricity at the same time as Denmark, which means we will often struggle to export this electricity. This issue already exists today.

2. Wind turbines only generate electricity when the wind blows. For approximately 40-60 days per year, other energy sources will need to cover the electricity demand. Current information does not explain where this electricity will come from during calm weather.

3. A portion of the surplus electricity is intended for Power-to-X (PtX) production, such as fuel for aviation. PtX requires both hydrogen (H) and carbon (C). Hydrogen can come from wind-powered electricity, but the source of carbon is unclear. Will it come from CO2 captured at power plants in Zealand or Jutland—plants that political parties simultaneously demand to shut down? The other Energy Island will presumably also require CO2 from Zealand.

4. In addition to the estimated costs of 38 billion kroner and 210 billion kroner for the Energy Island projects, further investments will be needed for wind turbines, PtX facilities, pipelines, and long underwater power cables. This could add another 100 billion kroner, though the exact amount is unknown.

5. Assuming these cost estimates are accurate, the total expense would be around 300 billion kroner, which equates to 50,000 kroner per Dane, including infants, or 200,000 kroner per average household.

6. Although some of the investment is expected to come from private funds, this does not change the fact that the projects place a significant financial burden on society. This money could be used for initiatives with more certain benefits.

7. The costs of wind power, along with the additional required investments, are now so high that Denmark could instead build 4-5 nuclear power plants. These nuclear plants would provide reliable electricity regardless of wind conditions, without the need for energy islands. They would meet all Danish and EU climate requirements for the next 50-60 years, whereas offshore wind turbines typically last only 20-25 years.

I suspect that most members of Parliament who approved these projects have very little understanding of these issues. Even Dan Jørgensen dismissed the idea of nuclear power in Berlingske last year as 'completely unrealistic,' despite its clear advantages over the Energy Island plan.

I also think that since people don't want a wind turbine within their line of sight, it won't be any easier with a nuclear power plant. You can't compare the time or cost it takes to build a nuclear power plant in China with Europe. Hinkley Point C is yet another example that is expensive and takes much longer than the 5-6 years. For the cost of Hinkley Point C, you could have an energy island that produces three times as much energy

A wind turbine today generates electricity at a cost of approximately 25-30 øre per kWh. If that were rounded down to 21 øre, it would correspond to about 1/10 of what we actually pay in Denmark due to our high taxes on electricity. Considering that a Danish family has an electricity bill of around 500-800 DKK per month, it would drop to about 50-80 DKK per month if the taxes were removed!

Why are there people who would rather have a nuclear reactor, which could make a large area uninhabitable for thousands of years, for what amounts to 1/4 of the cost of YouSee’s mid-tier TV package?

The project sounds expensive, foolish, and not very green at all. What happens when there is no wind? How does nuclear power compare to the promised 12 GW in terms of output? It seems both faster and cheaper. And regarding the claim at timestamp 3:48, where Denmark is described as the EU's largest oil producer: that's misleading. It's only because Norway and the UK aren't part of the EU. In reality, Denmark produces much less than Norway.

I mean they require a fuck tonne of steel, concrete, and copper. Not exactly “green”, and not destructive, and I’m a massive supporter of nuclear.

And the monitoring of waste for centuries probably use quite a bit of energy too.

And it’s not renewable, uranium will run out.

How does a nuclear power plant compare to the promised 12 GW here? It’s likely both faster and cheaper.

Building a nuclear plant should be considered instead of pursuing the Danish 'Energy Island' projects. These projects involve occupying two islands with wind turbines made of high-maintenance glass fiber and plastic, which frequently degrade and break down. The wind turbines would require constant and hazardous maintenance in the sea throughout their operational lifespan. Additionally, the energy islands would become zones of environmental harm, littered with dead birds, creating an unsightly and destructive impact.

God forbit they'd consider building a nuclear plant.

No, let's occupy two islands with high-maintenance glass fibre and plastic fans which degradate and break down all the time. Which require permanent and dangerous maintenance, out in sea, for their whole life. Plus it will be a nice island of death riddled with bird carcases, what a pretty sight.

Of course, it costs money to build a nuclear power plant, and of course, it produces waste—that’s an argument often used.  

But the point is that wind turbines do the same. Used wind turbine blades, which take up significantly more space than nuclear waste, are currently just being buried.

The wind turbine portion of the energy island project costs "only" 80 billion. The rest is for P2X and five large underwater cables. By comparison, the Finnish nuclear reactor OL3 ended up costing just over 80 billion and will only generate about 1/4 of the electricity expected from the wind turbines in the North Sea. Now, OL3 is a bit of a cautionary tale, but it is more the rule than the exception that nuclear power plants run over schedule and end up costing significantly more than anticipated.

The Danish population is not willing to live near a nuclear power plant, and Denmark lacks a competent, internationally recognized regulatory authority.

Here's the translation:


Even before Klima Dan's energy islands are fully planned, the cost has exceeded that of a couple of nuclear power plants. This project has a direct negative impact on the climate and environment, without any measurable effect on CO2 levels. The economic negative impact, on the other hand, is significant.

The real calculations argue against wind energy, especially in a country like Denmark, which has the world's most developed district heating network. The indoctrination against nuclear power is so deeply ingrained that it can nearly be considered religious. This, combined with a generation of politicians influenced by the wind industry, makes nuclear power nearly impossible to implement in Denmark.

The desperation is evident, as solutions are being sought for the questionable energy security. Power-to-X (PTX) is one such technology, but it has never been scaled, and it is unlikely to ever reach the required scale. Hydrogen, in particular, is a challenging element to work with due to its explosive nature and extreme volatility.

Why do nuclear power supporters always use ridiculous statistics from countries like India or decades-old projects?

The reality is that Denmark has a large wind industry, is capable of producing wind turbines at competitive prices, and has the necessary infrastructure to support it. Additionally, Denmark can export its wind industry to foreign markets, which is another significant benefit.

Denmark lacks a nuclear energy industry. The country does not have the necessary knowledge, expertise, infrastructure (both for connecting to the power grid and for maintenance), or Danish companies in the sector. Building a nuclear power plant would quickly turn into a nightmare, with costs escalating by a factor of 2-3, delays of over a decade, and political opposition throughout. Furthermore, all the money would go to French or American companies.

I believe the Kintore-Fiddes-Tealing transmission line in Northeast Scotland was intended to support offshore wind power, but the industry is only marginally viable. Recent reports from Orsted and Vattenfall highlight difficulties, despite receiving subsidies under the Contract-for-Difference scheme, which is now outdated given current energy prices.  

I see that the government’s obsession with reaching Net Zero at all costs could strain the industry further. Many countries are already turning back to fossil fuels or nuclear power to ensure energy security, while the UK faces a looming energy crisis with diminishing nuclear and fossil fuel capacity, inadequate battery storage, and reliance on imported energy.  

If the government fails to adjust its approach, I fear the UK could face serious energy shortages in the near future, as demonstrated by Scotland's energy vulnerabilities during extreme weather events.

Nuclear power is not an obvious complement to renewable energy because the cost of nuclear power increases as it is used less. Unlike fossil power plants, where reducing output can significantly cut costs, the fuel cost for nuclear is a very small part of the total energy price. This makes it harder and more expensive to combine nuclear with renewable energy. A nuclear power plant needs to have enough capacity to provide power when it’s not windy and the sun isn’t shining, but it also needs to be able to reduce output during sunny, windy periods. 

Additionally, traditional nuclear power plants are not designed to rapidly adjust their output, though this is technically feasible in the future, albeit at an additional cost.

It was a sensible decision to abandon the plans for an energy island. If offshore wind farms must be built far out at sea, the best approach would be to use platforms to convert the electricity and bring it ashore at the nearest coast.

However, the idea of energy islands has resurfaced!

The investment funds are partly expected to come from pension funds, which have been seduced by Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP)'s enticing promises. It is glaringly obvious that those responsible within the pension funds have no understanding of energy supply or wind turbines and apparently have little interest in gaining such knowledge.

CIP is proposing ten energy islands at a total cost of 2,200 billion DKK. For the same amount, we could construct a significant number of nuclear power plants and obtain a large amount of stable and inexpensive electricity. What are we doing?

Especially the Moderates and Lars Aagaard are on a blind mission to push through the deployment of renewable energy. They are even willing to use emergency powers to bypass approval procedures. Citizens' and environmental concerns are being disregarded. The primary purpose of the Energy Island at Bornholm is to supply Germany, which seems like favoritism toward the larger neighbor, especially considering Germany's own energy supply mismanagement.

The island is also a prime target for Putin, given its location in the Baltic Sea. In general, the transition to renewable energy is a disaster for the citizens involved, who are effectively being expropriated for massive wind turbines, solar fields, and gigantic PtX plants. This huge blunder could have been avoided with increased Scandinavian cooperation on nuclear power. The Finns know how to do it—learn from their latest reactor, OL3, and build according to that blueprint.

Denmark should reconsider the Energy Island projects, which seem like unrealistic ambitions, and instead explore the feasibility of investing in Sweden's expansion of its existing nuclear power industry. Energy Island Bornholm appears to be an economic disaster, as the latest calculations from the Danish Energy Agency estimate it will require a staggering DKK 31.5 billion in state subsidies. Politicians are unwilling to cover this full amount and have agreed to a subsidy cap of DKK 17.6 billion, which is approximately half the projected cost.

I am deeply skeptical of large public projects like the Energy Island projects, as they often face significant cost overruns—up to four or five times the original estimate—and are delayed by a decade or more. Fortunately, the Energy Island projects seem far off, giving nuclear power a chance to take the lead instead. 

There is also a critical, unaddressed question regarding the impact of massive offshore wind farms on wind systems. Energy is not created from nothing—it is extracted from existing systems. Altering wind patterns could have serious consequences, as winds influence cloud formation and movement, affecting weather systems. Yet, no one has studied this thoroughly. I reached out to Wind Energy Denmark and Vestas for answers, but received nothing. Even Bjørn Lomborg acknowledged the issue's importance, though no progress has been made.

I prefer nuclear power. We should begin with the nuclear technology available now and improve upon it as advancements become ready for deployment.

Denmark should reconsider the "Energy Islands" concept, which seems like a far-fetched idea, and instead explore the possibility of investing in the Swedish expansion of their existing nuclear power industry. The Energy Island project on Bornholm is shaping up to be an economic disaster. Recent calculations from the Danish Energy Agency show that the Bornholm Energy Island is expected to require staggering state subsidies of 31.5 billion Danish krone. However, politicians are not initially willing to cover the full cost and have instead set a support ceiling of about half that amount, 17.6 billion krone.

The Swedish government, and thereby taxpayers, must provide a debt guarantee of 300 billion SEK for four nuclear reactors because the companies planning to build them cannot assume the risk or secure financing.  

Nuclear power is historically known for costing 3-4 times more than projected and taking 2-3 times longer to complete. This highlights the significant risks associated with constructing nuclear power facilities.

The decision to halt certain aspects of the Energy Island project is a sensible one given the current geopolitical and energy landscape. Forming a new government in Belgium can take a very long time, and in Germany, with its deeply flawed energy policies, a governmental shift is necessary. The current Danish Vice Chancellor appears disconnected from reality. Germany is Europe’s largest importer of electricity, primarily relying on French nuclear power, while Denmark also imports electricity from countries with reliable green energy sources. 

Denmark’s current approach to projects like the Energy Island, which heavily relies on intermittent renewable sources such as wind and solar, is unsustainable. If all countries adopted similar policies, energy production would halt during periods without sunlight or wind. Investing in battery capacity as an alternative for projects like the Energy Island would be prohibitively expensive, costing approximately Denmark's entire annual GDP (2,800 billion DKK). 

Despite these challenges, organizations like Green Power Denmark remain adamantly opposed to nuclear power. This resistance perpetuates the shortcomings of initiatives like the Energy Island and similar projects. The continuation of these flawed policies is likely until a blue (conservative) government is in place.

Taxpayers should not face additional financial pressure, yet nuclear energy is being promoted as a solution? I question how a waste storage facility, requiring ongoing management for 200–1000 years, can compete with the cost of a cross-border electricity grid. Regarding the new reactors mentioned, where are these reactors located, and how much do they actually contribute to the energy production of their respective countries? 

Are we discussing Russia’s floating reactor with 35 MW, one of the two Chinese reactors with 250 MW, or India’s research reactor? These capacities are negligible and do not meaningfully impact the current energy landscape. Claiming that such reactors can significantly lower CO2 emissions is misleading. 

What energy sources would be used in the construction of these reactors, especially if renewables are dismissed? What are the CO2 implications of this? Additionally, these new reactors are less fuel-efficient than traditional designs. What is the real purpose here, other than promoting narrow lobbying interests? 

Renewables eliminate the need for baseload capacity, and baseload capacity is unnecessary. Flexibility is the key to building resilience for the changes ahead.

The Baltic Eagle wind farm near Rügen, with a nominal capacity of 476 MW, is estimated to cost 1.6 billion euros, or about 12 billion kroner. With a 50% utilization rate, the specific investment amounts to 52 billion kroner per GW. This is considerably more expensive than a Korean-built nuclear power plant. Additionally, the costs include long cables, backup power when the wind isn't blowing, and economically unrealistic projections for Power-to-X (PtX) technology.

In 2023, wind power across 13 northwestern European countries ranged from 5.6 GW to 121 GW, with an average of 46 GW and a standard deviation of 52% of the average. 

Wind power should be recognized as viable only to a very limited extent. It's time to stop looking to the misguided idealists from 40-50 years ago, who stood in front of Christiansborg Palace and sang: "What should go in? Sun and wind! What should go out? Barsebæk!" 

We ended up with 20 wind turbines at Middelgrunden, with a total capacity of 40 MW and an average output of 8.8 MW in 2023, varying between 14 MW in October and 4.1 MW in June. Such variation significantly limits the usefulness of wind power, which led us to build an 800-900 MW power plant at Avedøre to replace Barsebæk. This plant still emits some carbon dioxide, so it wasn't exactly a green transition.

The gaslighting continues. Our electricity bills have become more and more expensive the more "green" energy is connected to the grid. That is a fact so far.  

In addition, despite Denmark's unique geographical position with access to wind, hydroelectric power from Norway, and nuclear power from Sweden, it has still not managed to provide Danes with cheaper electricity bills, even with one of the world's highest renewable energy penetrations. It's a farce: "just one more wind turbine/energy island, and it'll work."

I believe the Danish government is fully aware that the Bornholm energy island is a loss-making project, yet it hasn’t been scrapped. So why should the North Sea energy island, or the new 6 GW offshore wind project in the North Sea, be any different? The Bornholm project, which started as a 2 GW offshore wind farm, was initially budgeted at DKK 39.4 billion, but has now ballooned to DKK 70 billion for just 3 GW. The North Sea energy island, originally estimated at DKK 52.8 billion for 3 GW, will likely cost DKK 233.333 billion for 10 GW. And if it's built as a steel platform, the cost could rise to DKK 319.933 billion. With the cost of 1 GW of offshore wind turbines increasing by 5.111 billion kroner, the Bornholm project could end up costing DKK 85.333 billion for 3 GW, while the North Sea energy island as steel platforms could reach DKK 371.004 billion for 10 GW. This brings the total construction budget for both projects to around DKK 456.377 billion, not including additional costs for electrical installations and caisson islands. Over 60 years, the combined investment in these two projects could reach nearly 913 billion kroner, but it’s unclear if they will ever be profitable. Compared to nuclear power, which may have lower overall costs, particularly with the economies of scale it could achieve, I wonder if these wind projects are really the best option. Wind and solar power come with high costs for additional capacity and grid changes, while nuclear power, which is similar to today’s thermal plants, could end up being more cost-effective in the long run.

We are securing external financing to build an energy island for 50 billion DKK that will produce as much energy as a nuclear power plant and won’t be completed until 2036. The cost and time are not the issue. If they were, we would also oppose the wind farms currently under construction.  

There is no solution to the problem of what will back up wind and solar if we want a clean, climate-friendly energy grid. The current solution—and what will remain the solution—is fossil-fueled power plants, which, incidentally, emit more radioactive particles into the air than a nuclear power plant.  

The truth is that we don’t actually care about the environment or the climate in this country. As long as we can polish our image with a few wind turbines, we’re happy to burn fossil fuels to support the unstable wind and solar energy systems, which cost just as much, if not more, and take just as long to roll out.

Nuclear power is far too expensive. Just look at England as an example. If everyone starts using uranium on a large scale, it will also become a scarce resource. Solar and wind energy are renewable and sustainable. Extracting raw materials, like uranium, will only lead to geopolitical conflicts, just as we have seen with gas and oil. Denmark does not have suitable locations for storing nuclear waste, and we still have unresolved issues with waste from Risø. Even new nuclear power technologies produce waste that requires disposal. Instead, we should focus on utilizing Denmark’s maritime areas to generate energy.

As a representative of Vattenfall, I can confirm that offshore wind farms like Kriegers Flak offer significant advantages. Located approximately 40 kilometers from the Danish coast, Kriegers Flak is Denmark's largest offshore wind park. The wind speeds this far out at sea are both high and consistent, resulting in very stable energy production throughout the year.

Since September, our 72 turbines have been operational, capable of generating 600 megawatts of electricity - enough to power 600,000 Danish households. While building such an offshore wind park is significantly more complex than onshore installations, we've successfully collaborated with Luxembourg-based companies like Jan De Nul from Capellen, who have been crucial partners in this 1.3 billion euro project.

This expertise will be valuable for Denmark's planned energy island project, which aims to install wind turbines capable of producing 10,000 megawatts - equivalent to 2.5 times the output of the Cattenom nuclear power plant. We continue to expand our offshore wind operations, having just signed another project with Jan De Nul to install 50 additional wind turbines in the Baltic Sea.

There is no need for more green energy in Northern Europe when the wind is blowing because we already have enough capacity. The idea that green hydrogen could make it profitable is unrealistic due to the massive price difference between green and grey hydrogen, and there is no willingness to force consumers to pay for it. People will not accept a lower standard of living for the sake of the climate, no matter how one feels about it. This is reflected in voting patterns. 

In our geography, it is not possible to obtain stable and cheap electricity. Nuclear power is suitable for baseload generation, but it is not cheap and will not make us globally competitive in terms of energy prices. In Europe, we must accept that our geography and geology are not favorable. There are no plausible energy storage solutions that seem capable of solving this problem, unfortunately.

The Danish government's plan to build energy islands is a costly and flawed venture. The lack of interest from private investors, as evidenced by the absence of bids for these projects, speaks volumes about the economic viability of such undertakings. The low return on investment and the government's involvement as a co-owner make these projects unattractive to businesses.

Perhaps it's time to reconsider nuclear power. While nuclear energy could be a more viable and efficient solution, I suspect that the political climate is not yet ready for such a shift. It's unfortunate that politicians often resist changing their minds, even when the evidence points to a better alternative. If we were to become more open-minded, we might be able to find more effective and sustainable solutions to our energy challenges.

The failure of the Danish "Energy Island" projects is total. Denmark's energy and climate policy, which clings to wind power as the country's salvation, is exposed as deeply flawed. The largest tender ever for a domestic offshore wind farm, intended to build gigantic wind turbines in the North Sea to cover the energy consumption of over half of Denmark's population, has received no bids—none at all. Not even Ørsted, Denmark’s state-owned energy company, or private companies like Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners showed interest.

This fiasco reveals how the business model, which places all risks on bidders while demanding annual concession payments to the Danish state, is fundamentally unworkable. It also exposes the arrogance of Denmark's climate policy. The tender for nine gigawatts of offshore wind, with the first phase of three gigawatts approved by the Danish Parliament in May 2023, now appears to be collapsing.

Offshore wind farms are prohibitively expensive to build, and the current cost estimates far exceed previous projections. At the same time, Denmark and the rest of Europe face an overwhelming challenge: building affordable and reliable energy supplies, an issue that has become more urgent than meeting climate targets. This failed tender also has severe implications for other energy plans, including the two proposed "Energy Islands" in the North Sea and on Bornholm. The North Sea Energy Island has been postponed indefinitely due to high costs, and Energy Island Bornholm, which was already predicted to be unprofitable, must now also be considered financially untenable. The 8.7 billion kroner required for its construction was supposed to come from revenues from offshore wind in the North Sea.

It was a grave mistake to rely almost exclusively on offshore wind. It was unwise to embrace wind turbines with such blind faith while rejecting alternative solutions like nuclear power, which Denmark's Social Democrats have opposed for decades in pursuit of CO2-neutral energy. Now, everyone is left to suffer from the consequences of this failure, and we all know who will ultimately foot the bill for this debacle.

THE COLD SHOWER  

The FAILURE seems total. Denmark’s energy and climate policy, clinging to wind as the country’s savior, is now exposed like a winter swimmer regretting halfway down the pier.  

The largest tender ever for a domestic offshore wind farm, involving the construction of giant turbines in the North Sea to supply energy equivalent to the consumption of more than half of Denmark’s population, has received zero bids. None. Not even from the state-owned company Ørsted.  

Nor from energy profiteers like Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners.  

THIS REVEALS not just how flawed the business model is—with all risks placed on the bidder and the demand for annual concession payments to the Danish state—but also the self-righteous face of Danish climate policy.  

The tender for building nine gigawatts of offshore wind—three gigawatts in the first round—was approved by Parliament in May 2023. But the politicians’ one-sided reliance on wind power is now losing momentum.  

OFFSHORE WIND FARMS are outrageously expensive to construct. None of the earlier price estimates come close to reflecting the actual costs that are now evident.  

Meanwhile, Denmark—and Europe as a whole—faces an overwhelming problem: building cheap and reliable energy. This issue is becoming more urgent than meeting climate targets.  

The failed tender has, of course, significant consequences for other related energy plans. Until recently, politicians also planned two 'energy islands'—one in the North Sea and one on Bornholm. These were meant to convert wind into electricity, providing green power to 13.3 million European households.  

The North Sea energy island has been postponed indefinitely. It’s too expensive.  

And if 'Energy Island Bornholm' wasn’t already predicted to be unprofitable, it must be now. The 8.7 billion kroner for its construction was supposed to come from revenues generated by wind farms in the North Sea.  

IT WAS NOT WISE to bet almost everything on offshore wind. It has been foolish to adhere so religiously to wind turbines while rejecting alternatives like nuclear power, as the Social Democrats have done for decades in pursuit of CO2-neutral energy.  

The problem now is that we’re all left shivering in the draft of the slammed door from the tender round.  

And we all know who will end up paying for this debacle.

The Danish "Energy Island" projects appear to focus solely on expanding wind power. However, Denmark must invest in either nuclear power or a large-scale energy storage solution instead of relying solely on wind power. Depending exclusively on wind power without adequate storage is not a sustainable strategy. 

Southern Sweden is highly frustrated because Denmark's reliance on wind energy negatively affects them as well. Despite this, Denmark seems content with the current situation and appears unaware that relying on pure wind power without storage is flawed. Even Germany has acknowledged this issue, yet Denmark dismisses Germany's failures and acts as though it is handling the situation better.

Look into reopening Germany’s nuclear plants to increase the supply of electricity on the market and thus lower the price.
It’s not well thought out if we are to live with the consequences of the construction without benefiting from the electricity, while simultaneously seeing the electricity disappear to the German market.
When they are more than capable of producing their own electricity with their closed facilities.

I strongly oppose the Energy Island project near Bornholm in its current form. First, the agreement provides poor benefits for Bornholm residents regarding our electricity supply. Second, the financial aspects of the project are not properly controlled. Third, it is absurd to place such industrial installations in an area where people come specifically to experience nature.

These three arguments alone are more than sufficient to conclude this is a bad idea. Instead, Germany should reopen its nuclear power plants to increase the electricity supply in the market and thereby lower prices.

The project is poorly conceived if Bornholm residents must live with the consequences of the construction without benefiting from the electricity, while watching the power being exported to the German market - especially when Germany could easily produce its own electricity by reopening their closed nuclear facilities.

The Danish "Energy Island" projects will negatively impact southern Sweden, at the very least. If Denmark had chosen to build nuclear power plants instead of relying on the proposed 700 MW from wind power, it would have benefited the entire region. However, Denmark is unlikely to make that choice.

Political parties are exploiting the high electricity bills to appear relatable, but they are not willing to confront the solar and wind industries. Parties like Lars Bøje Mathiiesens Borgernes Parti, Liberal Alliance, and Konservative advocate for removing the electricity tax and introducing nuclear power, but they do not address the root cause: subsidies for the solar and wind industries. Only Dansk Folkeparti has clearly demanded a total stop to further expansion and support for solar and wind. Without this, removing the electricity tax will not increase disposable income for Danes, as the money will be taken through other means like taxes. The solar and wind industries have significantly exploited Danes, and the hidden subsidies are extensive. Parties that do not demand a total stop to further expansion of solar and wind are untrustworthy and will continue to accept the direct cause of high electricity bills.

Ed Miliband's obsession with wind and solar, far from giving us energy security, will leave us out of pocket, dependent on foreign imports, and at risk of blackouts.  

'As I said last year, we need to build more gas power plants and nuclear, so we can have cheap, reliable energy.'

I am afraid folks are missing the big picture regarding fiberglass shards in the water. Windmill blades wear out due to the constant abrading of their leading edges. They are filled and repaired until they become beyond repair, creating a constant source of the finest and sharpest form of microplastics. This pollution is much like asbestos in that it never goes away.

I've seen photos and heard conversations about the massive areas of blades being buried in landfills, where the bulldozers look like ants compared to the blades and landfill area. This scale of reality is alarming.

For those who compare this issue to oil, they need to realize that oil is a natural substance consumed by aerobic microbes. It ultimately goes away or settles back into its natural environment. Even nuclear waste has a natural life cycle. However, this glass particulate does not and will destroy the food chain on both farmland and in the ocean.

We need to address this issue urgently to protect our environment and health.

Germany already has many wind turbines, so it doesn’t make sense to have a cable from Danish/Bornholm wind turbines. If it’s very windy in Denmark, it’s also windy in Germany, so Germany doesn’t need Danish wind power when their own turbines produce more than enough. And when it’s not windy, and Germany needs to import Danish electricity, Energy Island Bornholm can’t help because it’s also not windy in Denmark. Drop this project and invest the billions in Swedish nuclear power, and lay an additional cable to Sweden.

Excellent news for the people of Bornholm's wallets. Let this insane project remain postponed indefinitely. The Germans will most likely restart their nuclear power plants after the German election in February, and hopefully, they will focus less on unstable wind/solar energy.

The plans for Energy Island Bornholm have been postponed until a new German government, following the election on February 23, is ready to negotiate potential co-financing for the energy island. Bornholm's politicians expect this will only lead to a minor delay in the project. However, this might be somewhat naive. Friedrich Merz is the most likely chancellor after the election, and his view on wind power differs significantly from most Danish politicians. He prefers to focus on nuclear power instead. If Energy Island Bornholm is to be realized, it will likely be funded by Danish taxpayers. The Danish government has made a U-turn and is opening up for state subsidies for offshore wind. Initially, this will only cover new tenders for 2-3 gigawatts of offshore wind, while a large ongoing tender for areas in Denmark's internal waters is canceled. The climate minister has stated that political support for this will be sought, and hopes that there will also be public backing. State subsidies can only come from one source: the Danish people. Personally, I believe many Danes would prioritize many other things over the construction of offshore wind turbines.

The government’s energy policy is collapsing. No one wants to build the offshore wind farms that are supposed to power everything. The Energy Island Bornholm project is hanging by a thread. The hydrogen infrastructure can only work if it receives massive state subsidies. The uncertainties are enormous, and the financial risk for the Danish people is huge. Now, the state wants to take on some of the risk for the companies that have so far been unwilling to bid on the project. This means that the state will let you – the taxpayers – bear the risk… But why don’t private companies want to take on these tasks if they are such a good business opportunity? You can think about that.

The whole green climate circus just doesn’t work. We don’t need more uncertain energy sources like solar panels or wind turbines. 

We need reliable, stable, and efficient nuclear power. We need lower energy taxes. In short, we need a completely new energy and climate policy based on climate realism and common sense.

Do you agree?

Bribery is happening again. 🤬
"If wind energy is a Christmas tree, then it was a Christmas tree where all the parties expected to pick banknotes, but now we have to hang some notes on the tree," says Lars Aagaard.
Oh, that's right, we have no corruption in Denmark...
Stop the environmental destruction with wind turbines and solar panels, which is also a bad business, and switch to clean and stable nuclear power instead.

STOP the renewable energy madness – the energy policy is a farce!

Danes are paying the highest electricity prices in the EU. Higher than Germany. Higher than France. Higher than any other country in the EU. And this is not a coincidence – it is a direct result of the government's catastrophic energy policy.

The government has pumped billions of taxpayer money into wind turbines and solar panels, but what have we received? Unstable energy, sky-high prices, and a food sector suffering under electricity bills that have spiraled out of control. When electricity fluctuates up and down like a rollercoaster at Tivoli, the bill is directly passed on to consumers and businesses. The result? More expensive food, more expensive goods, and higher inflation.

It is time to stop the expansion of renewable energy. The latest fiascos with the Energy Island Bornholm and the three failed tender rounds highlight that urgent action is needed.

The good news is that there is an alternative – nuclear power!

While the government insists on continuing its green puppet show, Dansk Folkeparti has long proposed a real solution: Let us try to buy the Brokdorf plant in northern Germany – one of the safest and most efficient nuclear power plants in Europe, which the Germans have decided to shut down, but which we could easily reopen and operate until fourth-generation nuclear power is ready.

Instead, Mette Frederiksen and Lars Løkke are pouring billions into projects that don’t work. They live in the illusion that we can close stable energy sources and replace them with solar and wind, which only work when the weather allows. This is not energy policy – it is an expensive and dangerous game with the economy and future of Denmark.

Let us be clear:
❌ STOP wasting taxpayer money on renewable energy!
❌ STOP the insane electricity prices that are ruining the Danish economy!
✅ START a serious push for nuclear power – the only solution that can ensure cheap, stable, and CO2-free energy for Denmark!

Denmark deserves better.
