6868,nuclear,Statement,"That sounds expensive, foolish, and not particularly green, actually.

What happens when the wind doesn’t blow?

How does a nuclear power plant compare to the promised 12 GW here? It’s likely both faster and cheaper.

6917,nuclear,Statement,The energy island system was initially developed as a technology to improve the integration of large-scale power and enable long-distance transmission with significantly higher efficiency due to reduced energy losses. Ho
6981,nuclear,Statement,"I believe that Denmark's energy transition is progressing too slowly. Therefore I advocate for repealing the 1985 nuclear power ban, stating that sustainable energy sources like wind and solar cannot meet the demand alon"
7111,nuclear,Statement,"I wonder if anyone has noticed that a huge concentration of energy supply creates an obvious target in a conflict, which could be even worse than the present dependence on gas. I also wonder why nuclear power is never co"

7128,nuclear,Statement,Energy islands are sustainable as long as the wind blows... Sigh sigh sigh... It's a scandal that no one dares to talk about nuclear power... It's incredible that a party like NB is the only one with some brains in the e
7131,nuclear,Statement,And then the wind turbines have to be replaced every 25 years. A nuclear power plant easily produces stable electricity for 80 years. The Energy Islands are a completely crazy project.
7137,nuclear,Statement,"A lot of negativity here in this Reddit thread. Either it's too expensive, or it's not nuclear power or high-speed trains.
I think the energy island seems like a good idea. If we are to reduce our dependence on fossil fu"
7141,nuclear,Statement,"We’re only making ourselves more dependent on burning fossil fuels and biomass with unreliable energy sources like the energy island.
Nuclear power, yes please!"
7148,nuclear,Statement,"Screw wind turbines, nuclear power is even greener.
There’s also nuclear fusion. If this becomes a success in France, there will be plenty of green energy without waste.
It’s called the ITER project, where many countries"

7193,nuclear,Statement,"A new large nuclear power plant costs 15-20 billion. It provides good green energy that can supply Denmark and neighboring countries with electricity on windless days. Place the plant in Køge, lay a cable to Bornholm, an"
7298,nuclear,Statement,"I think the decision made by the Danish Parliament in 1985 to ban nuclear power plants for electricity production in Denmark should be reconsidered. The technology has advanced since then, and I am eager to find a sustai"
7314,nuclear,Statement,"How many nuclear power plants have been shut down, decommissioned, and completely removed from the face of the Earth? Do we know the total cost of a nuclear power plant over its entire lifespan and after its closure?"
7318,nuclear,Statement,Isn’t there some truth in the idea that Denmark should capitalize on its leading position in wind power and leave nuclear power to other countries?
7320,nuclear,Statement,"I think a mixed solution is best. Wind turbines and solar panels are cheaper and quicker to build, but they aren't stable. Nuclear power is stable, but it's expensive and slow to develop. This is mostly the case in Europ"
7367,nuclear,Statement,"The same model is used in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and also in existing Danish offshore wind farms like Anholt and Krieger's Flak. 

The price depends on electricity consumption. If consumption rises with "

7422,nuclear,Statement,"After the election in Germany, nuclear power plants will be restarted. Nuclear power is more stable, and then in Denmark, the crazy plans for Energy Island Bornholm can be dropped. Maybe it's time to also consider nuclea"
7427,nuclear,Statement,"Germany already has many wind turbines, so it doesn’t make sense to have a cable from Danish/Bornholm wind turbines. If it’s very windy in Denmark, it’s also windy in Germany, so Germany doesn’t need Danish wind power wh"
7434,nuclear,Statement,The government’s energy policy is collapsing. No one wants to build the offshore wind farms that are supposed to power everything. The Energy Island Bornholm project is hanging by a thread. The hydrogen infrastructure ca

7442,nuclear,Statement,Nuclear power should be off the table for discussion. Preserve Danish nature and produce energy that can be controlled according to needs.

Danes are paying the highest electricity prices in the EU. Higher than Germany. Higher than France. Higher than any other country in the EU. And this is "
7455,nuclear,Statement,"If we've discovered that wind energy is not as cheap as we all thought and still requires government subsidies, then there’s really no good argument left for not using nuclear power.

It’s completely stupid to throw bill"
