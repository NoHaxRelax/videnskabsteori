# Concept Glossary — Science, Technology & Society (STS)

## Analytical Concepts

### 1. Normative Ethics
Framework for judging what is morally right or good. Focuses on what *should* be done, not just what *is*.

### 2. Consequentialist Ethics
Judges actions by their outcomes. An action is right if it maximizes overall utility (e.g. welfare, wellbeing).

### 3. Deontological Ethics
Judges actions by duties, rights, and principles rather than outcomes (e.g. Kant, Rawls).

### 4. Virtue Ethics
Focuses on character, virtues, and moral relationships rather than rules or consequences.

### 5. Interpretative Flexibility
Technologies can be interpreted and used differently by different social groups.

### 6. Script
Implicit assumptions about users and use embedded in a technology’s design.

### 7. Explicitly Political Technologies (Winner)
Technologies deliberately designed to enforce specific political or social arrangements.

### 8. Inherently Political Technologies (Winner)
Technologies that require particular forms of social organization to function.

### 9. Paradigm & Thought Collective (Kuhn)
Shared assumptions and standards guiding what counts as valid knowledge in a scientific community.

### 10. Interactional Expertise & Trading Zones
Ability to communicate across expert domains without full technical mastery.

### 11. Contributory vs. Interactional Expertise
Contributory: ability to produce knowledge.  
Interactional: ability to talk competently with experts.

### 12. Performativity (of Markets)
Economic models and theories shape markets rather than just describing them.

### 13. Framing
Defining what is included or excluded in how a problem or market is presented.

### 14. Market Devices
Tools and arrangements (prices, standards, metrics) that organize and enable markets.

### 15. Market Socio-Technical Agencements (STAs)
Assemblages of humans, technologies, rules, and infrastructures that make markets work.

### 16. Users
Users actively shape innovation through adaptation, feedback, and modification.

### 17. Non-Users (Wyatt)
People who do not use a technology (resisters, rejecters, excluded, expelled), shaping its trajectory.

### 18. Wicked Problems
Problems with no clear definition or optimal solution due to value conflicts and uncertainty.

### 19. Cultural Theory of Risk (Douglas)
Risk perceptions reflect cultural values and social organization.

### 20. Grid / Group Model
Maps social organization via levels of regulation (grid) and group cohesion (group).

## Methodological Concepts

### 21. Post-Demographics
Studying digital actors without assuming user accounts equal real individuals.

### 22. Just Observe
Methodological stance: describe controversies without imposing theory too early.

### 23. Second-Degree Objectivity
Objectivity achieved by acknowledging perspective and mediation.

### 24. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Open-ended data exploration to detect patterns before formal testing.

### 25. Close / Distant Reading
Zooming in on individual texts vs. analyzing large-scale patterns.

### 26. Quali-Quantitative Analysis
Combining qualitative interpretation with quantitative methods.

### 27. Principle of Symmetry
Explain all positions using the same analytical tools—no “truth bias.”

### 28. Actor (ANT)
Any human or non-human entity that makes a difference in a network.

### 29. Follow the Actors
Trace how actors define problems and mobilize arguments.

### 30. Weighing Positions
Assessing arguments by structure and robustness, not popularity.

### 31. Measurements
Measurement practices shape what becomes visible and actionable.

### 32. Circulating Reference
Chain of transformations linking reality to representations (data, graphs).

### 33. Truth & Robustness
Truth emerges through building arguments resilient to critique.

### 34. Toulmin Model of Argumentation
Arguments consist of claims, grounds, warrants, backing, qualifiers, rebuttals.

### 35. Technical Mediation
Technologies actively transform meaning; they are not neutral carriers.

### 36. Explanatory Visualization
Visuals used to *argue*, not just explore—must explain interpretation.

### 37. Annotation
Textual guidance embedded in visuals to highlight key patterns.

## Interventional Concepts

### 38. Public Engagement
Including citizens and stakeholders as participants, not passive recipients.

### 39. Universal Design
Designing for inclusivity from the start rather than retrofitting accessibility.

### 40. Social Acceptance
Degree to which a technology is supported socially, shaped by trust and fairness.

### 41. Anticipation
Systematically exploring possible future impacts under uncertainty.

### 42. Reflexivity
Critically examining one’s own assumptions, values, and problem framings.

### 43. Responsiveness
Ability to change direction when new concerns, values, or knowledge emerge.
