# Week 1 Concept Overview — Sustainability & Engineering

## Core Sustainability Concepts

### Sustainability (Brundtland Definition)
Development that meets present needs without compromising future generations’ ability to meet theirs.

### Three Dimensions of Sustainability
Environment, society, and economy — must be addressed together, not in silos.

### Systems / Nested View of Sustainability
The economy exists within society, which exists within the environment.

### Sustainability Challenge
We know what to do, but face trade-offs, conflicts, and slow implementation.

---

## SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals)

### SDGs
17 globally agreed goals guiding sustainable development until 2030.

### Targets & Indicators
Concrete metrics (169 targets, 304 indicators) used to assess progress.

### MDGs → SDGs
Shift from narrow poverty focus to a **holistic global agenda**.

### SDG Types
- People (social wellbeing)
- Planet (environmental limits)
- Prosperity (economic systems)

---

## Engineering & Society

### Engineer’s Role in Society
Designs systems under constraints of safety, cost, regulation, and values.

### Value-Laden Engineering
Engineering decisions always embed social and political values.

### Engineering as a Change Agent
Engineering actively shapes future societies, not just technologies.

### Responsibility of Engineers
Not just *can we build it?* but *should we, and for whom?*

---

## Limits & Constraints

### Planetary Boundaries
Biophysical limits defining a safe operating space for humanity.

### Absolute vs Relative Sustainability
- Relative: “better than before”
- Absolute: “within planetary limits” (harder, necessary)

---

## Gaps & Tensions

### Importance–Ability–Action Gap
We care about sustainability, know how to help, but don’t act enough.

### SDG Trade-offs
Progress on one SDG can undermine another.

### Global Inequality
Sustainability challenges differ massively across regions.

---

## Motivation & Purpose

### Purpose-Driven Engineering
SDGs provide meaning, direction, and coordination across disciplines.

### Legacy Thinking
Engineers must ask: *what future am I actively building?*


# SDG Method – Phase 2 & 3 Concept Overview

## Core Method Concepts

### SDG Methodology
A semi-quantitative life cycle–based method for assessing how a technology shift contributes to the SDGs.

### Baseline System
The existing system before a technology change.

### New System
The system after the technology change is implemented.

### Technology Shift
The change introduced between the baseline and new system.

---

## Phase 2: Scoping

### Functional Output
The precise function delivered by the system, used to ensure fair comparison between systems.

### Fair Comparison
Baseline and new systems must deliver the same functional output.

### Scoping
Defining how much of the system to include in the assessment.

### Life Cycle Perspective
Assessing impacts across:
- Materials & components
- Production
- Use & maintenance
- Recycling / end-of-life

### Process
A distinct activity within the life cycle (e.g. mining, production, use).

### Process Diagram
A structured visual representation of all relevant processes in a system.

### Iteration
Repeated refinement of scope and system boundaries as understanding improves.

---

## Phase 3: Effects

### Effect
A change caused by the technology shift, defined as a difference between baseline and new system.

### Direct Effects
Effects directly caused by the change and aligned with its purpose.

### Indirect Effects
Unintended or secondary effects affecting other systems or actors.

### Physical Effects
Changes in material flows, energy use, emissions, or resource extraction.

### Non-Physical Effects
Changes in social, economic, or organizational conditions.

### Added Process
A process that exists only in the new system.

### Removed Process
A process that existed in the baseline but not in the new system.

### Increased / Reduced Process
A process whose magnitude changes due to the technology shift.

---

## Tools

### SDGUI
Web-based tool used to register and structure effects in relation to SDGs.

### Draw.io / PowerPoint
Tools used to construct Phase 2 process diagrams.

### Queueue
Web-based system for requesting TA assistance.



# SDG Method – Phase 4 & 5 Concept Overview

## Phase 4: Impact Assessment

### SDG Impact
The influence an effect has on one or more SDGs.

### Causality Chain
A logical sequence linking an effect to SDG impacts via intermediate consequences.

### SDG Interlinkages
Interactions where progress or decline in one SDG affects others.

### Direction of Impact
Whether an effect contributes positively or negatively to an SDG.

### Likelihood
Estimated probability that an SDG impact will occur.

### Impact Size
Estimated magnitude of the impact relative to the SDG target.

### Semi-Quantitative Assessment
Structured scoring using direction, likelihood, and size instead of precise numbers.

### Scoring Matrix
Framework combining likelihood and size to assign symbolic impact scores.

### SDG Visualization
Graphical overview of SDG impacts across life cycle stages.

---

## Phase 5: Interpretation

### Key Sustainability Aspects
The most important environmental, social, or economic impacts of the technology change.

### Hotspots
Life cycle stages or processes with particularly large positive or negative impacts.

### Trade-offs
Situations where improving one SDG negatively affects another.

### Intervention Points
Places in the system where changes can significantly alter outcomes.

### Recommendations
Actionable suggestions aimed at decision-makers.

### Short-Term vs Long-Term Actions
Distinction between immediate improvements and structural changes over time.

---

## Good Practice Principles

### Reflexive Assessment
Actively questioning your own assumptions and conclusions.

### Balanced Argumentation
Considering both positive and negative impacts seriously.

### Transparency
Making uncertainties and assumptions explicit.

# Week 1 — Day 04 & 05 Concept Overview

## Social Sustainability

### Social Sustainability
Assessment of how technologies affect human wellbeing, equity, rights, and social conditions.

### Wellbeing Economy
An economic system aimed at enabling good lives for all within planetary boundaries.

### Human Needs
Fundamental, non-negotiable requirements for wellbeing (distinct from preferences).

### Preferences
Wants and desires that are relative, unlimited, and culturally shaped.

### Psychological States
Wellbeing defined through subjective experiences (happiness, stress, satisfaction).

### Theory of Human Needs
Wellbeing framework emphasizing sufficiency and satiability rather than “more is better”.

---

## System Thinking

### Upstream Solutions
Preventive interventions targeting root causes in system design and production.

### Downstream Solutions
Reactive interventions addressing symptoms after harm occurs.

### Value Chain
Sequence of activities from raw material extraction to end-of-life.

### Social Hotspots
Stages or locations in a value chain with high social risk or impact.

---

## Phase 5: Interpretation

### Interpretation
Making sense of SDG impact results by identifying what matters most.

### Key Sustainability Aspects
The most significant positive and negative impacts of a technology change.

### Trade-offs
Situations where improving one SDG worsens another.

### Stakeholders
Actors with power, responsibility, or exposure to impacts (e.g. policymakers, firms, users).

### Recommendations
Concrete, actionable proposals to improve sustainability performance.

### Short-Term Actions
Improvements achievable with existing structures and technologies.

### Long-Term Actions
Structural or systemic changes requiring time, regulation, or innovation.

### Elevator Pitch
Clear, concise communication of findings tailored to decision-makers.
