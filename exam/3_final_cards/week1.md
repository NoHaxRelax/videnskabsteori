# MC-Optimized Mochi Cards — Sustainability & SDG Method (Week 1)

What best defines sustainability (Brundtland)?
---
Meeting present needs without compromising future generations’ ability to meet theirs.
!!!

Which elements must sustainability always include?
---
Environmental, social, and economic dimensions together.
!!!

Which statement matches the nested sustainability model?
---
The economy exists within society, which exists within the environment.
!!!

Which is a core sustainability challenge?
---
Known solutions exist, but implementation is slowed by trade-offs and conflicts.
!!!

What are the SDGs primarily?
---
A global political framework guiding sustainable development until 2030.
!!!

How are SDGs operationalized?
---
Through targets and indicators used to assess progress.
!!!

What changed from MDGs to SDGs?
---
From a narrow poverty focus to a holistic global agenda.
!!!

Which SDG category focuses on environmental limits?
---
Planet.
!!!

Which role best captures engineers’ responsibility?
---
Designing systems while considering societal values and consequences.
!!!

Why is engineering considered value-laden?
---
Because technical choices embed social and political values.
!!!

What distinguishes engineering as a change agent?
---
It actively shapes future societies, not just technologies.
!!!

What question defines responsible engineering?
---
Not only “can we build it?” but “should we, and for whom?”
!!!

What are planetary boundaries?
---
Biophysical limits defining a safe operating space for humanity.
!!!

Which best describes absolute sustainability?
---
Operating within planetary limits.
!!!

Which best describes relative sustainability?
---
Improving performance compared to a previous state.
!!!

What is the importance–ability–action gap?
---
People care and know solutions but fail to act sufficiently.
!!!

What are SDG trade-offs?
---
Progress on one SDG negatively affecting another.
!!!

Why is global inequality central to sustainability?
---
Because sustainability challenges differ greatly across regions.
!!!

What is purpose-driven engineering?
---
Using SDGs to provide direction, meaning, and coordination.
!!!

What does legacy thinking ask engineers to consider?
---
The long-term future their solutions help create.
!!!

What is the SDG Method?
---
A semi-quantitative life-cycle method to assess SDG impacts of technology shifts.
!!!

What defines the baseline system?
---
The system before a technology change.
!!!

What defines the new system?
---
The system after a technology change is implemented.
!!!

What is a technology shift?
---
The change introduced between baseline and new systems.
!!!

Why is functional output critical?
---
To ensure fair comparison between systems.
!!!

What makes a comparison “fair”?
---
Both systems deliver the same functional output.
!!!

What is scoping in the SDG method?
---
Defining which parts of the system are included in the assessment.
!!!

Why adopt a life cycle perspective?
---
To capture impacts across production, use, and end-of-life.
!!!

What is a process in life cycle analysis?
---
A distinct activity such as mining, production, or use.
!!!

What is the purpose of a process diagram?
---
To visualize all relevant processes in the system.
!!!

Why is iteration necessary?
---
Understanding improves, requiring boundary refinement.
!!!

What is an effect in Phase 3?
---
A difference between baseline and new systems.
!!!

What characterizes direct effects?
---
They align with the purpose of the technology shift.
!!!

What characterizes indirect effects?
---
They are unintended or secondary consequences.
!!!

What distinguishes physical effects?
---
They involve material, energy, emissions, or resources.
!!!

What distinguishes non-physical effects?
---
They affect social, economic, or organizational conditions.
!!!

What is an added process?
---
A process present only in the new system.
!!!

What is a removed process?
---
A process present only in the baseline system.
!!!

What does an increased or reduced process mean?
---
Same process, different magnitude after the shift.
!!!

What is an SDG impact?
---
The influence an effect has on one or more SDGs.
!!!

What is a causality chain?
---
A logical link from effect to SDG impact.
!!!

What are SDG interlinkages?
---
Interactions where changes in one SDG affect others.
!!!

What does direction of impact describe?
---
Whether the effect is positive or negative.
!!!

What does likelihood capture?
---
The probability that an SDG impact occurs.
!!!

What does impact size capture?
---
The magnitude relative to the SDG target.
!!!

Why is the assessment semi-quantitative?
---
It uses structured scoring instead of exact numbers.
!!!

What is the role of a scoring matrix?
---
To combine likelihood and impact size into symbolic scores.
!!!

What does SDG visualization show?
---
Impacts across life cycle stages.
!!!

What are key sustainability aspects?
---
The most important positive and negative impacts.
!!!

What are hotspots?
---
Life cycle stages with particularly large impacts.
!!!

What defines a trade-off in interpretation?
---
Improving one SDG worsens another.
!!!

What are intervention points?
---
Places where changes can significantly alter outcomes.
!!!

What are recommendations in Phase 5?
---
Actionable guidance for decision-makers.
!!!

What distinguishes short-term actions?
---
They are achievable within existing structures.
!!!

What distinguishes long-term actions?
---
They require systemic or structural change.
!!!

What is social sustainability concerned with?
---
Wellbeing, equity, rights, and social conditions.
!!!

What is a wellbeing economy?
---
An economy enabling good lives within planetary boundaries.
!!!

How do human needs differ from preferences?
---
Needs are finite and non-negotiable; preferences are unlimited.
!!!

What do upstream solutions target?
---
Root causes through system design.
!!!

What do downstream solutions target?
---
Symptoms after harm occurs.
!!!

What is a value chain?
---
Activities from raw material extraction to end-of-life.
!!!

What are social hotspots?
---
Value chain stages with high social risk.
!!!

Who are stakeholders?
---
Actors with power, responsibility, or exposure to impacts.
!!!

What is the purpose of an elevator pitch?
---
Concise communication tailored to decision-makers.
!!!
