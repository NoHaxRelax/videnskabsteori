# Week 1 – Sustainability & Engineering (Mochi Cards)

Sustainability (Brundtland Definition)
---
Development that meets present needs without compromising future generations’ ability to meet theirs.
!!!

Three Dimensions of Sustainability
---
Environment, society, and economy — must be addressed together, not separately.
!!!

Systems / Nested View of Sustainability
---
The economy exists within society, which exists within the environment.
!!!

Sustainability Challenge
---
We know what to do, but face trade-offs, conflicts, and slow implementation.
!!!

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
---
17 globally agreed goals guiding sustainable development until 2030.
!!!

SDG Targets & Indicators
---
Concrete metrics (169 targets, 304 indicators) used to measure progress.
!!!

MDGs → SDGs
---
Shift from a narrow poverty focus to a holistic global sustainability agenda.
!!!

SDG Types
---
People (social wellbeing), Planet (environmental limits), Prosperity (economic systems).
!!!

Engineer’s Role in Society
---
Designs systems under constraints of safety, cost, regulation, and values.
!!!

Value-Laden Engineering
---
Engineering decisions always embed social and political values.
!!!

Engineering as a Change Agent
---
Engineering actively shapes future societies, not just technologies.
!!!

Responsibility of Engineers
---
Not only “can we build it?” but “should we, and for whom?”
!!!

Planetary Boundaries
---
Biophysical limits defining a safe operating space for humanity.
!!!

Absolute vs Relative Sustainability
---
Relative: better than before. Absolute: within planetary limits.
!!!

Importance–Ability–Action Gap
---
We care about sustainability, know what to do, but fail to act enough.
!!!

SDG Trade-offs
---
Progress on one SDG can undermine another.
!!!

Global Inequality
---
Sustainability challenges differ massively across regions.
!!!

Purpose-Driven Engineering
---
SDGs provide meaning, direction, and coordination across disciplines.
!!!

Legacy Thinking
---
Engineers must ask: what future am I actively building?
!!!

SDG Methodology
---
A semi-quantitative life cycle–based method for assessing SDG impacts of technology shifts.
!!!

Baseline System
---
The system before a technology change.
!!!

New System
---
The system after a technology change is implemented.
!!!

Technology Shift
---
The change introduced between the baseline and the new system.
!!!

Functional Output
---
The precise function delivered by the system, used for fair comparison.
!!!

Fair Comparison
---
Baseline and new systems must deliver the same functional output.
!!!

Scoping
---
Defining how much of the system to include in the assessment.
!!!

Life Cycle Perspective
---
Assessing impacts across materials, production, use, and end-of-life.
!!!

Process
---
A distinct activity within the life cycle (e.g. mining, use, transport).
!!!

Process Diagram
---
A visual representation of all relevant processes in a system.
!!!

Iteration
---
Repeated refinement of scope and system boundaries as understanding improves.
!!!

Effect
---
A change caused by the technology shift between baseline and new system.
!!!

Direct Effects
---
Effects directly caused by the change and aligned with its purpose.
!!!

Indirect Effects
---
Unintended or secondary effects affecting other systems or actors.
!!!

Physical Effects
---
Changes in material flows, energy use, emissions, or resources.
!!!

Non-Physical Effects
---
Changes in social, economic, or organizational conditions.
!!!

Added Process
---
A process that exists only in the new system.
!!!

Removed Process
---
A process that existed in the baseline but not in the new system.
!!!

Increased / Reduced Process
---
A process whose magnitude changes due to the technology shift.
!!!

SDG Impact
---
The influence an effect has on one or more SDGs.
!!!

Causality Chain
---
A logical sequence linking an effect to SDG impacts.
!!!

SDG Interlinkages
---
Interactions where progress or decline in one SDG affects others.
!!!

Direction of Impact
---
Whether an effect contributes positively or negatively to an SDG.
!!!

Likelihood
---
Estimated probability that an SDG impact will occur.
!!!

Impact Size
---
Estimated magnitude of the impact relative to the SDG target.
!!!

Semi-Quantitative Assessment
---
Structured scoring using likelihood and impact size instead of exact numbers.
!!!

Scoring Matrix
---
Framework combining likelihood and impact size.
!!!

SDG Visualization
---
Graphical overview of SDG impacts across the life cycle.
!!!

Key Sustainability Aspects
---
The most important environmental, social, or economic impacts.
!!!

Hotspots
---
Life-cycle stages or processes with especially large impacts.
!!!

Trade-offs
---
Situations where improving one SDG worsens another.
!!!

Intervention Points
---
Places in the system where changes have high leverage.
!!!

Recommendations
---
Actionable suggestions aimed at decision-makers.
!!!

Short-Term Actions
---
Improvements achievable with existing structures and technologies.
!!!

Long-Term Actions
---
Structural or systemic changes requiring time, regulation, or innovation.
!!!

Social Sustainability
---
How technologies affect wellbeing, equity, rights, and social conditions.
!!!

Wellbeing Economy
---
An economy aimed at enabling good lives within planetary boundaries.
!!!

Human Needs
---
Fundamental, non-negotiable requirements for wellbeing.
!!!

Preferences
---
Wants and desires that are relative, unlimited, and culturally shaped.
!!!

Upstream Solutions
---
Preventive interventions targeting root causes in system design.
!!!

Downstream Solutions
---
Reactive interventions addressing symptoms after harm occurs.
!!!

Value Chain
---
Sequence from raw material extraction to end-of-life.
!!!

Social Hotspots
---
Stages or locations in a value chain with high social risk.
!!!

Stakeholders
---
Actors with power, responsibility, or exposure to impacts.
!!!

Elevator Pitch
---
Clear, concise communication of findings tailored to decision-makers.
!!!
