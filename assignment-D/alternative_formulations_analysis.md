# Alternative Formulations of "Energy Supply Security"

Based on analysis of the Actor statement corpus dataset, here are alternative formulations for "energy supply security":

## Key Alternative Formulations with Statement IDs:

### 1. **"Power adequacy"** (Statement ID: 35)
Found in Kraka Economics statement discussing energy security analysis.
- Full context: "Decreasing Urgency for Energy Security: Analysis from Energinet indicates that future concerns about power adequacy are less severe than previously believed."

### 2. **"Electricity supply security"** (Statement ID: 149)
Found in Lars Aagaard (Minister for Climate, Energy and Utilities) statement.
- Full context: "If we do not have the international connections via energy islands as originally envisioned with Energy Island Bornholm and Energy Island North Sea, then the Danish energy supply security is expected to face challenges leading up to and after 2030. This is outlined, among other things, in the Climate Program 2024. The government expects to address this challenge in a proposal on electricity supply security."

### 3. **"Energy security"** (Statement ID: 8)
Found in Kärnfull Energi statement.
- Full context: "No contribution to energy security, as additional wind turbines in the Baltic Sea will not solve this issue."

### 4. **"Energy independence"** (Statement ID: 212)
Found in Dan Jørgensen (Former Danish climate minister) statement.
- Full context: "With the expansion of Energy Island Bornholm and its connection to Germany, we are accelerating the development of renewable energy. This is crucial for the climate, but also absolutely essential for Europe's energy independence from Russia"

### 5. **"Stable electricity supply"** (Statement ID: 149)
Found in Lars Aagaard (Minister for Climate, Energy and Utilities) statement.
- Full context: "There are generally several different ways to ensure a stable electricity supply. Electricity trade over international connections can balance capacity challenges between price zones; controllable electricity production capacity, which is not weather-dependent, can ensure production when fluctuating energy sources are not producing..."

### 6. **"Supply reliability"** (Statement ID: 73)
Found in Jacob Østergaard (Professor, DTU) statement.
- Full context: "Denmark currently has the highest supply reliability in the world, which is a key reason why companies like Google and Facebook build data centers here—they trust the electricity will always be available. We must not compromise that reliability."

### 7. **"Security of supply"** (Statement ID: 253)
Found in context discussing energy system mechanisms.
- Full context: "The energy system's current mechanisms for redundancy and security of supply in the event of a malfunction in the largest units cannot handle units of the size represented by the energy islands."

### 8. **"European energy security"** (Statement ID: 4839)
Found in Kraka Economics statement (the original statement referenced in your assignment).
- Full context: "Energy Island Bornholm does contribute to European supply security, making this a political decision."

## Summary of Key Concepts:

The dataset reveals that "energy supply security" is discussed through multiple lenses:
- **Technical adequacy**: power adequacy, electricity supply
- **Geopolitical independence**: energy independence (particularly from Russia)
- **System reliability**: supply reliability, stable electricity supply
- **Infrastructure resilience**: security of supply, redundancy mechanisms

## Additional Observations:

1. **Expertise**: The discussions around these formulations involve multiple types of actors:
   - Economic think tanks (Kraka Economics)
   - Technical experts (DTU professors)
   - Government ministers (Dan Jørgensen, Lars Aagaard)
   - Industry representatives
   - Energy companies

2. **Criticism patterns**: Kraka Economics frequently criticizes the economic justification while acknowledging supply security benefits, while government officials and industry representatives emphasize European energy security and independence from Russian energy.

3. **Context shift**: The concept evolved from technical "supply security" discussions to broader "energy independence" narratives, particularly after 2022 (likely related to the Ukraine conflict).
