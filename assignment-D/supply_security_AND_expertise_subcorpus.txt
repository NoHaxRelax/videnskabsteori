The establishment of a Belgian-Danish cable is an important next step in making our electricity system more
sustainable. This project will enhance supply security and allow us to continue pioneering innovative
technologies, giving our businesses a competitive edge on the international stage. The collaboration with
Energinet is vital to achieving these goals and ensuring the success of the energy island initiative.

Italy's "110%" initiative is a smart approach to boosting energy efficiency. Homeowners who upgrade their
property to at least 3 energy classes higher receive substantial tax bonuses over the next 20-30 years. Banks
can purchase these tax credits, providing homeowners with immediate cash for the upgrades.    This benefits
everyone: citizens save on energy costs and increase property value; banks earn from the sale of tax credits
and interest on loans; the government reduces infrastructure costs and increases energy independence.
Contractors and engineers have plenty of work, and politicians enjoy higher GDP and long-term electoral
benefits.    The model encourages reduced consumption while increasing production of energy-efficient homes.

I am pleased to announce that we at Energinet are now beginning to explore the possibility of allowing the
people of Bornholm to benefit from the electricity produced by the upcoming energy island in the Baltic Sea.
The preliminary conclusion comes after an initial analysis, which shows that connecting Bornholm’s electricity
grid to the energy island's future power connections would lead to socio-economic savings. The analysis also
confirms that this can be done without compromising the stability or security of supply in Bornholm’s
electricity grid and without delaying the project timeline.  We have had a good and close dialogue with
Bornholm’s Regional Municipality. I fully understand the desire of the people of Bornholm to reap the benefits
of a connection – both in terms of consumption and production of green electricity on the island. That is why
I am incredibly pleased that we can now work towards connecting Bornholm’s electricity grid to the energy
island’s power connections.

Bornholm currently relies on a submarine cable to Sweden for power, which was due for renovation. To ensure
supply security, Energinet funds a Bornholm power plant to provide backup power in case the cable fails. This
cost could be eliminated if the Bornholm power grid is connected to the energy island's cables.

The North Sea is becoming a driving force behind our energy independence. However, in light of the recent acts
of sabotage on the Nord Stream gas pipelines, protecting this critical infrastructure from sabotage and
attacks has become more important than ever. We are committed to securing both the cables that deliver
electricity to the mainland and the energy island against such events.  Recently, we passed a law that
significantly strengthens these protective measures. We are now ensuring video surveillance at sea, using
drones, monitoring foreign vessels in our waters, and commissioning competent authorities to conduct regular
security assessments.

What an exciting hashtag - Offshore Week! Only the hashtag - NorthSeaSummit23 in Ostend, now the annual
conference of hashtag - WindEurope in Copenhagen. We are present there until tomorrow with and with our joint
stand. Today, Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark saw an idea of how our three energy islands Princess Elisabeth
Island (Elia Group), Bornholm Energy Island (Hashtag - #50HertzEnerginet) and North Sea Energy Island
(Energinet) will contribute to taping the hashtag – offshore potential in the North and Baltic Sea – and thus
represent another innovative step to ensuring hashtag – supply security and Europe. Together with Energinet ,
we want to build a stream slit cross from on the island of Bornholm. There, alternating current is to be
converted into high-voltage direct current (HVDC) and distributed as required. More than 525 kV sea and land
cable systems are transported to substations on the Danish island of Zealand and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. In
this way Hashtag#CombinedGridSolution , we are launching another innovative project with our Danish
transmission grid partner in order to integrate efficiently and into energy systems, which is generated by
wind power from the sea efficiently and across countries – and thus further networking Europe's electricity
system. Hashtag > EuropeanOffshoreGrids On our new project website you can find more information on this:

The North Sea will become the engine of our energy independence. The Princess Elisabeth Island will be an
essential link in this. Our country has long been a pioneer in the field of offshore wind power with companies
such as DEME and Jan De Nul, which are world leaders. They are proving it once again with these plans for the

The agreement signed by Danish Climate Minister Lars Aagaard and German Economy Minister Robert Habeck in
Luxembourg represents a crucial step for Denmark and Energinet. The development of very large offshore wind
farms and international connections is vital for Denmark's political ambitions to export both green
electricity and green hydrogen through future hydrogen pipelines in Denmark. These initiatives will support
the decarbonization of Germany's industrial sector.  The joint project in the Baltic Sea, together with
Energinet's North Sea projects, will significantly impact Europe's green transition. The cooperation with
German transmission operator 50Hertz on Energy Island Bornholm marks a shift away from point-to-point
connections between individual countries. In the future, offshore wind power will flow to where demand is
highest through offshore high-voltage direct current networks.  Energy Island Bornholm will create another
trading connection between the German and Danish electricity markets. This is economically feasible and will
increase both countries' security of supply under new geopolitical circumstances. The expansion of large
offshore wind farms and international connections aligns with political ambitions and plans to export green
energy, supporting the broader European green transition.

Denmark can maintain high electricity supply security even under extreme weather conditions, despite the
European electricity system increasingly relying on solar and wind energy. This security can be ensured
through straightforward measures without significantly raising overall electricity supply costs. These
measures include making electricity consumption more flexible, storing energy, and investing in reserve
capacity for critical situations.   However, the transformation of the energy system will place greater
pressure on electricity supply security due to a significant increase in electricity consumption and the
growing reliance on solar and wind energy, which cannot be regulated as easily as traditional power plants. By
2040, nearly all Danish electricity production will come from renewable sources, and electricity consumption
will rise substantially, driven by national and EU policies to expand offshore wind and solar power while
electrifying a significant portion of energy use.   The challenges to electricity supply security are
manageable, but implementing the necessary solutions—such as flexible consumption, energy storage, and reserve
capacity—will take many years. Authorities must act promptly to address these challenges to avoid potential
electricity shortages during peak demand periods when renewable sources cannot meet inflexible consumption.
Ensuring supply security requires robust planning, including addressing reliance on varying energy sources,
diminished dispatchable power plant capacity, and uncertain availability of electricity imports during
stressed conditions.

We acknowledge the critical importance of energy security and combating climate change for the future of the
European Union. We recognize that recent geopolitical events have highlighted the urgent need to replace
fossil fuels, especially Russian oil, coal, and gas, with European renewable energy from the North Sea,
including offshore wind electricity and green hydrogen, to support both EU climate neutrality and energy
security.   We further acknowledge the cooperation established between Denmark, Germany, Belgium, and the
Netherlands in the “Esbjerg Declaration” of May 18th, 2022, which envisions the North Sea as a Green Power
Plant of Europe. In our view, offshore renewable energy hubs and a meshed offshore grid are essential for
generating, connecting, converting, and transporting offshore wind energy in the North Sea.   We note
Germany’s plans to establish offshore renewable energy clusters with a 10 GW capacity in the North Sea by the
mid-2030s and Denmark’s plans to create a Danish Energy Island with up to 10 GW capacity by 2040.
Additionally, we recall the EU Marine Strategy Directive and our joint commitment to achieving good
environmental status for all European seas, including the North Sea.  We have agreed on the necessity of this
Joint Declaration of Intent (JDoI) to focus on cooperation for connecting Germany’s planned offshore renewable
energy hubs with Denmark’s Energy Island. Our primary objective is to facilitate mutual benefits by improving
energy security, increasing socio-economic welfare, diversifying energy sources, meeting EU and national
renewable energy targets, and integrating wind power with hydrogen and Power-to-X technologies.  To achieve
this, we propose the establishment of a Joint Working Group led by energy ministries, supported by energy
authorities and Transmission System Operators (TSOs). This group will develop a pre-feasibility study
analyzing technical, environmental, and economic aspects and deliver a joint recommendation by the first half
of 2024. This recommendation will guide the next steps toward realizing the project, aiming for implementation
by the mid-2030s.  We emphasize that this JDoI creates no binding obligations under international law and
imposes no financial commitments unless mutually agreed. Cooperation costs are borne by the respective
Participant. Any amendments to this JDoI require joint written consent, and any misunderstandings will be
resolved collaboratively in good faith and mutual trust.   This JDoI takes effect upon signature and may be
terminated with three months' written notice. Termination does not affect ongoing activities unless otherwise
decided.  Signed on April 24th, 2023, in Ostende.

Energinet estimates that approximately 1 billion Danish kroner can be saved through this solution. This is
because, according to Energinet, expenses for power supply via the seabed cable can be eliminated if the
Bornholm electricity grid is connected to the Energy Island's cables.  Bornholm residents can also expect
"relatively stable electricity prices" by connecting to the Energy Island's electricity production.

As a representative of Vattenfall, I can confirm that offshore wind farms like Kriegers Flak offer significant
advantages. Located approximately 40 kilometers from the Danish coast, Kriegers Flak is Denmark's largest
offshore wind park. The wind speeds this far out at sea are both high and consistent, resulting in very stable
energy production throughout the year.  Since September, our 72 turbines have been operational, capable of
generating 600 megawatts of electricity - enough to power 600,000 Danish households. While building such an
offshore wind park is significantly more complex than onshore installations, we've successfully collaborated
with Luxembourg-based companies like Jan De Nul from Capellen, who have been crucial partners in this 1.3
billion euro project.  This expertise will be valuable for Denmark's planned energy island project, which aims
to install wind turbines capable of producing 10,000 megawatts - equivalent to 2.5 times the output of the
Cattenom nuclear power plant. We continue to expand our offshore wind operations, having just signed another
project with Jan De Nul to install 50 additional wind turbines in the Baltic Sea.

It is technically possible and also a socio-economically good idea to connect the Bornholm electricity grid to
the offshore wind turbine project Energiø Bornholm. This is stated in a response from Energinet, which has
been published in Bornholms Tidende. Here, Energinet points out that the people of Bornholm will be able to
get better security of supply and relatively stable electricity prices. According to the plan, Bornholm Energy
Island will supply green power from offshore wind turbines to up to three million households in Germany and
Zealand. Energinet now concludes that the people of Bornholm can also take part in the green electricity.
However, the connection will have costs that Energinet is still calculating. In the end, it is the Minister of
Climate, Energy and Utilities who must approve Bornholm's connection to the Energy Island.

It is misleading that you are creating a narrative that the Bornholm Energy Island will cost Danish taxpayers
DKK 31.5 billion. The Bornholm Energy Island encompasses both offshore wind and infrastructure and should be
assessed based on its socio-economic impact. - The Danish Energy Agency has omitted several factors in their
calculation of the socio-economic impact. Our point is that we also need to include expected EU support,
positive socio-economic impact from the connection to Bornholm, security of supply in DK2, technological
advantages for Danish businesses, and in the long term, the opportunities to develop Bornholm into a dedicated
hub with connections to especially Poland, but also Sweden. To emphasize my points, I believe it is crucial
that we accurately represent the Economic Council of Advisors. They have not, as you write, recommended
abandoning the Bornholm Energy Island. They have recommended that updated socio-economic analyses be prepared,
incorporating more factors to provide a better basis for decision-making.

50Hertz Transmission GmbH views the Danish "Energy Island" projects as critical for advancing European energy
sovereignty and achieving climate neutrality. At the Baltic Offshore Wind Forum, 50Hertz signed two Letters of
Intent to strengthen international cooperation in offshore wind energy and grid interconnection. The first
agreement, with transmission system operators in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, focuses on developing
offshore wind energy projects and meshed offshore grids in the Baltic Sea. The second agreement, with
Estonia’s Elering, outlines the Baltic WindConnector, a 750-kilometer hybrid submarine cable that will
transmit large amounts of offshore wind energy from Estonia to Germany, enhancing energy security and climate
goals for both nations.  50Hertz emphasizes its ongoing collaboration with Denmark’s Energinet, including the
Combined Grid Solution at Kriegers Flak and plans for the Bornholm Energy Island. These projects will act as
energy hubs, enabling the flexible transmission of wind power between Denmark and Germany. 50Hertz highlights
the strategic potential for Baltic states to become exporters of green electricity, benefiting Central Europe
by increasing energy security, diversifying renewable energy sources, and supporting Germany’s efforts to
achieve climate neutrality and industrial decarbonization by 2045.

The debate about Energy Island Bornholm lacks perspective. This project is not just about Bornholm.    Energy
Island Bornholm represents a transformative initiative with three key pillars: climate impact, industrial
leadership, and geopolitical security. It is critical for Denmark and Europe to maintain a visionary approach
to transition away from fossil fuels, ensuring a greener and more secure future.    Firstly, Energy Island
Bornholm serves as a catalyst for the green transition, not only by delivering green electricity to 3-4
million households and reducing CO₂ emissions by over 3 million tons annually but also by spearheading
innovations for future energy islands. In particular, its role supports Europe's ambitious goal of 300 GW
offshore wind by 2050, making such targets achievable cost-effectively.    Secondly, this project secures
Denmark’s technological and industrial leadership in green energy, especially wind technology. By acting as a
test and innovation platform, it ensures Danish companies remain at the forefront of energy island
development, safeguarding their competitive edge in global markets.    Thirdly, from a security perspective,
Energy Island Bornholm reduces Europe's dependency on Russian oil and gas by enhancing energy self-reliance.
It is a vital infrastructure for connecting Baltic and European electricity markets and scaling offshore wind
energy in the North Sea.    Criticisms of Energy Island Bornholm’s economic viability often fail to consider
the broader societal and strategic benefits. While the Energy Agency’s 2023 calculations show a potential
deficit of 4 billion DKK, this does not account for key value drivers, including Denmark’s leadership in wind
technology, potential revenue from international energy connections (e.g., a cable to Poland estimated to
improve economics by 15-20 billion DKK), and expected EU funding.    Additional benefits like energy security,
job creation, Power-to-X production, and Bornholm's economic integration further underscore the project’s
importance. Energy Island Bornholm is a long-term investment in critical infrastructure, with the potential to
generate economic growth, strengthen Denmark’s position as a wind energy leader, and support Europe’s green
and security agendas.

The Danish Energy Agency (Energistyrelsen) has assessed the socio-economic consequences of various
configurations of the Bornholm Energy Island project, which includes wind farms, a transformer station on
Bornholm, and grid connections to Denmark and Germany. The central estimates for the socio-economic impact
across all scenarios are negative, with potential losses ranging from 4 billion DKK to 17 billion DKK.
Additionally, the project is expected to require public subsidies amounting to 31.5 billion DKK over the first
approximately 20 years of operation. Of this amount, 17.6 billion DKK has already been politically approved as
of May 2023. The approved funding will be sourced from anticipated revenues from the 6 GW offshore wind tender
(8.7 billion DKK), the Green Fund (4.9 billion DKK), and future fiscal space (4.0 billion DKK). However, an
additional subsidy of approximately 14 billion DKK is needed because the wind farms associated with the energy
island are not expected to be profitable, and no specific financing has been identified for this amount. Given
the negative socio-economic outlook, the project should be reconsidered. The current socio-economic assessment
does not account for several effects that are difficult to quantify, such as energy supply security and
potential Power-to-X production. Therefore, it is recommended that a new socio-economic analysis be conducted,
incorporating as many relevant effects as possible. If it cannot be demonstrated that the project will
generate a socio-economic surplus, it should be abandoned.

Energy Island Bornholm  The text below is the introduction to my note on Energy Island Bornholm. You can no
longer attach a file or a link to posts on LinkedIn, but I am happy to send the entire note to those
interested.  Energy Island Bornholm is intended to pave the way for Denmark to maintain its leading position
as a green pioneer country. The Economic Council has warned about the project's poor economic viability. An
article in Jyllands-Posten on December 25, 2024, highlights the benefits that are not included in the economic
analyses, including Denmark's technological leadership, the path to new international electricity connections,
supply security, and job creation on Bornholm. These are airy and well-known arguments. When trying to gain a
more concrete understanding of the project, it turns out to be wrapped in many words but with few useful
details. This is especially true for the project's technical design. My conclusions about Energy Island
Bornholm:  It is a serious democratic problem that parts of the documentation for such a large public
investment are kept secret. There is almost no publicly available information about the chosen technical
solutions. This prevents technically interested parties from assessing the project's technical risks. Since
Energinet's "Business case" from 2022, the expectation of the project's economic viability has significantly
deteriorated. Therefore, it must be decided whether the project should be changed or abandoned. The choice of
an energy island over a platform solution results in the concentration of large energy transactions in a few
points, thereby increasing the vulnerability of the electricity supply in Denmark and the rest of Europe. In
light of increased international tensions, this choice should be reconsidered. The technical interconnection
on the energy island is described in Energinet's risk assessment as "immature." This is an understatement, as
the interconnection is challenging and has so far only been attempted on a full scale in very few places in
the world. No Danish companies develop or produce HVDC equipment, so it serves no Danish interest to rely on
untested solutions. Multiterminal offshore HVDC solutions should not be included in the project in any form
until the necessary new technologies are fully tested elsewhere. Analyses of alternative solutions have been
neglected. Due to poor economics and technological uncertainty, the project should be put on hold until all
relevant solutions are properly investigated and evaluated.

I want to stress that the economic foundation for Energiø Bornholm is highly challenged. The state's estimated
cost is 31.5 billion DKK, according to civil servants in the Danish Energy Agency, while the agreement parties
estimate it at only 17.6 billion DKK, as politicians have set a cap on how expensive the project can be for
Danes.  Due to the poor economy, advocates have shifted to non-economic arguments such as energy security and
large PtX potentials, but these do not hold up either. Wind turbines at Bornholm contribute only limitedly to
Danish energy security. The Danish Energy Agency has pointed out that additional wind turbines in the Baltic
Sea do not significantly increase electricity production during periods of low production. Moreover, the
international connection to Germany, which actually contributes to energy security, could likely be obtained
more cheaply.  There are many good reasons to increase electricity market integration between Northern and
Southern Europe, but it should be done properly and not just used as an excuse to continue with an
economically disastrous project where the part of the project that can be justified could be obtained more
cheaply.  Furthermore, Bornholm is not suitable for producing hydrogen and other PtX products due to high
costs. A report from DTU, which compares production costs on Bornholm with those in Western Europe, the USA,
and China, shows that it would be most expensive to produce hydrogen and further process it into ammonia on
Bornholm. This means that PtX production on Bornholm is unlikely to be competitive in terms of price.  We
still have not heard a single good argument for establishing the billion-dollar Energiø Bornholm.

"If it cannot be documented that the project provides a socio-economic surplus, it should be dropped."  This
is what the Economic Council wrote about Energy Island Bornholm in their autumn report 2024. At the same time,
they recommended including more effects in the socio-economic assessment, such as supply security.  We have
therefore tried to determine whether the benefits of increased supply security are enough to justify the
project's struggling economy. The answer is no.  This is fundamentally due to:  ◾ The project has a socio-
economic deficit of 7 billion DKK, while a cautious estimate of the project's improvement in supply security
is valued at approximately 3 billion DKK.  ◾ An analysis from Energinet shows fewer problems with capacity
adequacy (whether there is enough power) going forward than previously assumed.  ◾ It is primarily the foreign
cable to Germany that contributes to supply security. However, it is hard to imagine that this could not be
obtained cheaper than via a detour over Bornholm.  ◾ The Climate Council has previously pointed out that
foreign connections are not the most effective way to increase supply security, as the sun shines and the wind
blows at roughly the same time in our neighboring countries. Therefore, there is a high probability that they
will lack power at the same times.  Even if new socio-economic calculations unexpectedly show a positive
socio-economic outcome, alternatives that solve the same task should always be compared. Here, it is not our
assessment that Energy Island Bornholm is the project that solves the task best.  We therefore assess that
increased supply security is unlikely to be sufficient to justify the energy island. That said, it is a good
idea to have the topic thoroughly analyzed by the Danish Energy Agency. However, there is not much time before
Energinet has to sign contracts on infrastructure, such as the power cable between Zealand and Bornholm, and
therefore it is important to put the entire project on hold until the analyses are completed. It will be
significantly more expensive to drop the project if contracts on expensive infrastructure have already been
signed.

The supporters of the Energy Island Bornholm project are changing the premise of the discussion instead of
doing the only responsible thing, which is to cancel the project. Politicians are avoiding making the right
but politically uncomfortable decisions. The original arguments for the project have proven unsustainable, and
new, unconvincing arguments are being invented. The project is now justified as a benefit for Germany and
Europe and as an expensive employment project for Bornholm. Economic experts, including Kraka Economics,
recommend canceling the project unless societal economic analyses show it benefits Danes. Political support is
wavering due to poor economic prospects, with significant state subsidies required. The remaining arguments
for the project, such as improved Danish supply security, lower electricity prices, and regional development
on Bornholm, are weak and do not justify the high costs involved.

The Danish Energy Agency's 2023 calculations indicate a deficit of DKK 4 billion for the Energiø Bornholm
project if Europe meets its climate goals. However, these calculations overlook several significant values
generated by Energiø Bornholm's visionary and innovative nature.    First, the Energy Island reinforces
Denmark's technological leadership by providing Danish companies with a platform to develop and export next-
generation wind technology. Second, international connections, such as a potential future cable to Poland as
suggested by Ørsted, could improve the project's economics by DKK 15–20 billion. Third, as a European Project
of Common Interest, Energiø Bornholm is well-positioned to secure significant EU funding, potentially up to
DKK 5 billion from the next allocation.    Moreover, the calculations do not account for additional benefits
such as improved energy security, overplanting capacity, Power-to-X (PtX) production, the connection to
Bornholm, and job creation on Bornholm. Energiø Bornholm represents a critical infrastructure investment with
far-reaching societal benefits, including economic growth, enhanced supply security, and bolstered Denmark's
strategic position as a global leader in wind energy.

I am pleased that Bornholm can be connected to the Energy Island. This sends a clear signal that both
Energinet and Christiansborg consider the Bornholm community a vital player in the major decision surrounding
Energy Island Bornholm. As a society, we should benefit from hosting the Energy Island.   Being part of a
larger facility and energy grid ensures supply security. We will experience fewer power outages in the future,
which is a great advantage. It also creates better opportunities for local projects and businesses to connect
to our network. This is a fantastic opportunity.   Additionally, it reinforces the narrative that Bornholm
thrives on sustainable energy.

The Danish Defence Ministry, under my leadership, acknowledges the concerns expressed by Borgerforeningen
Energiø Bornholm about the security, supply security, and socio-economic implications of the Energy Island
projects on Bornholm. The Defence Intelligence Service currently assesses that there is no immediate military
threat to Denmark. However, the broader threat environment has grown more complex, necessitating increased
efforts in preparedness, monitoring, and safeguarding Denmark's critical infrastructure. This work will
involve collaboration with infrastructure owners, private sector actors, and relevant authorities.  The
government is also focused on ensuring that crisis communication to the public is clear and rooted in
professional expertise. It is essential to avoid causing unnecessary fear while ensuring that citizens receive
relevant guidance when needed. Work on improving this type of communication is ongoing and will form part of
upcoming political discussions about enhancing Denmark's emergency preparedness framework.

In 2020, when the previous government made the initial agreement on the energy islands, it was assumed that
the offshore wind turbines would not only be self-financing but also cover the cost of the necessary
electricity infrastructure. However, in our assessment last year, we found that offshore wind alone couldn't
cover these costs. Consequently, it was politically agreed that there would be investment willingness in the
project corresponding to the infrastructure costs of 17.6 billion. At the same time, it was still assumed that
the offshore wind turbines should be able to sustain themselves. But whether this assumption holds true will
only be known once the tender process is complete.  The agreed state support – and thus the taxpayer cost – of
17.6 billion must be weighed against the benefits for electricity consumers, including lower electricity
prices and increased supply security, due to the large amounts of new wind power entering the grid.  As for
the gap between the estimated support need of 31.5 billion and the politically approved support of 17.6
billion, the truth will only be revealed once the large tender process is concluded. There is a possibility
that market actors may state that they cannot build the offshore wind turbines without support, which could
result in no bids. However, there are also price scenarios that suggest it could be attractive. We will test
this in the market, and the outcome of the tender will determine this discussion.  If no bids come in because
the terms, including the support framework, are unattractive to companies, I would then discuss the situation
with the political coalition. I cannot speculate further until we have new input from the tender process or
Energinet’s preparatory work.  Regarding the timeline for the tender, I am committed to it happening as
quickly as possible, but I do not have any updates on the schedule.  If, back in 2020, we had known that the
energy islands would not be profitable and would require support for the North Sea Energy Island of 50 billion
and for Bornholm Energy Island of over 30 billion, would the projects have been politically scrapped? That’s a
counterfactual question, but it’s easy to imagine that at the time, the political decisions seemed more

We at Kärnfull Energi DK believe that nuclear power is a far better solution than the Bornholm Energy Island,
which will require at least 31.5 billion DKK in state subsidies according to the Danish Energy Agency. This
amount is equivalent to three times the annual police budget. Nuclear power, on the other hand, does not
require state subsidies. We are ready to develop nuclear power projects in Denmark as soon as the ban on
nuclear energy is lifted.  The Bornholm Energy Island does not make economic sense. Analyses from Kraka show
that it faces so many challenges that it no longer seems viable. It provides no improvement in energy
security, as adding more offshore wind turbines in the Baltic Sea does not contribute to stability.
Additionally, producing PtX on Bornholm would be extremely expensive compared to using other energy sources.
In contrast, nuclear power can provide cheap and stable electricity and hydrogen, making large energy islands
unnecessary. Nuclear power plants could be placed near existing combined heat and power plants, avoiding
further industrialization of natural areas. Many of our customers have already saved thousands of kroner by
switching to 100% nuclear power agreements, avoiding overpriced and fixed-rate energy contracts.

Kraka Economics argues that increased energy security does not justify the poor economic viability of the
Energy Island Bornholm project. The key points underlying this conclusion are:  1. Economic Deficit: The
Energy Island Bornholm project has a societal economic deficit of 7 billion DKK, while the potential
improvement in energy security is conservatively valued at only 3 billion DKK.  2. Decreasing Urgency for
Energy Security: Analysis from Energinet indicates that future concerns about power adequacy are less severe
than previously believed.  3. Inefficient Contribution from Foreign Interconnectors: The interconnector to
Germany contributes most to energy security, but the same result could likely be achieved at a lower cost
without routing through Bornholm.  4. Limited Effectiveness of Foreign Interconnectors: The Danish Climate
Council has noted that interconnectors to neighboring countries are not the most effective way to improve
energy security because weather conditions (like sunshine and wind) tend to align across the region, meaning
power shortages are likely to occur simultaneously.  Kraka Economics emphasizes that even if new calculations
unexpectedly show a positive societal economic outcome, alternative solutions should always be considered. In
this context, Kraka Economics does not believe that the Energy Island Bornholm project is the optimal choice
for enhancing energy security.  Kraka Economics recommends pausing the Energy Island Bornholm project to allow
time for a thorough analysis by the Danish Energy Agency. However, Kraka Economics warns that contracts for
costly infrastructure, such as the electrical cable between Zealand and Bornholm, are imminent. If these
contracts are signed, it will become significantly more expensive to cancel the project later. Therefore, the
government must act swiftly to halt the project until all analyses are completed.

The establishment of Energiø Bornholm, Denmark's first energy island, will require significant investment,
including a 245 km direct current connection between Bornholm and Zealand and two 400 kW converter stations on
Bornholm and Zealand. This project, part of an agreement with Germany to link the energy island to the German
electricity grid, will cost Denmark approximately 13.9 billion kroner. This amount is a reduction from the
initial 16.9 billion kroner estimate due to the shared financial responsibilities with Germany.  The cost of
13.9 billion kroner will be distributed among Denmark's 3.3 million electricity customers through electricity
tariffs over time, amounting to an average of 4,200 kroner per customer. Payments will not be collected
through direct invoices but will instead be integrated into ongoing electricity tariffs managed by Energinet,
which oversees the operation and expansion of Denmark's electricity grid.  Energiø Bornholm is expected to
deliver a capacity of 3 gigawatts, equivalent to the output of 200 offshore wind turbines, each rated at 15
megawatts. While the project adds costs, Energinet is working to mitigate the impact on electricity tariffs.
In 2022, Energinet allocated 1.2 billion kroner to improve international electricity connections and plans to
return 1.6 billion kroner to consumers through tariff reductions, which will help lower electricity prices.
This project is critical to Denmark's green energy transition and the broader European energy network,
ensuring long-term sustainability and energy security despite the initial costs to electricity customers.

Nuclear power is a better alternative to the Energy Island Bornholm project and can save Danish taxpayers at
least 31.5 billion DKK, which is the estimated amount of state funding required for the energy island
according to the Danish Energy Agency. This amount equals three times the annual budget of the Danish police.
There is no need for state subsidies for energy. Kärnfull Energi is ready to build nuclear power plants in
Denmark without any state support.   The Energy Island Bornholm project lacks economic justification, as
concluded by analysis firm Kraka. Senior economist Frederik Læssøe Nielsen from Kraka has publicly requested a
single strong argument for establishing the Energy Island Bornholm, noting that the project faces so many
challenges that it no longer makes sense: - 💰 A minimum of 31.5 billion DKK in state subsidies, according to
the Danish Energy Agency. - 🔌 Adding more wind turbines in the Baltic Sea does not improve energy security. -
💧 Producing PtX on Bornholm would be extremely expensive, as it is cheaper to produce PtX using other energy
sources than offshore wind.  At Kärnfull, we have long questioned the excessively expensive energy island
projects. In contrast, nuclear power can deliver cheap and stable electricity and hydrogen without requiring
industrialization of natural areas.   Kärnfull Next is already developing nuclear projects in Sweden and is
interested in doing the same in Denmark if the ban on nuclear power is lifted. Nuclear power would eliminate
the need for large-scale energy islands by providing stable production of electricity, district heating, and
hydrogen. By locating nuclear power plants at existing power plant sites, we can avoid further industrializing
nature.   Additionally, many of our customers have saved significant amounts of money by switching to
electricity contracts with 100% nuclear power, avoiding overpriced fixed-rate plans or hidden fees. Nuclear
power offers a practical, economical, and sustainable energy solution for Denmark.

The Energy Island project on Bornholm is being described as an economic catastrophe unfolding in slow motion.
Why are politicians so fixated on this project? According to an analysis from the Danish Energy Agency in a
2023 memo referenced by the Ministry of Climate, the value of improved security in the electricity system is
estimated at 150 million kroner per year. This amount pales in comparison to the 31.5 billion kroner in state
subsidies required for the Energy Island project. Frederik Læssøe Nielsen, a Ph.D. in economics and senior

TV2/Bornholm has published yet another one-sided and incomplete article seemingly designed to provoke
unnecessary debate and division among the people of Bornholm. Alternatively, could it be an intentional effort
to generate public opposition to TREFOR? Contrary to claims, the power grid does not require an "overhaul" as
part of the Energy Island project. The 200 million kroner is solely intended to connect Energy Island Bornholm
with the local Bornholm power grid. This connection will enhance supply security and eliminate reliance on the
aging and increasingly inadequate submarine cable, which is insufficient for future consumption needs.
Additionally, this project will result in significant cost savings by reducing maintenance or replacement
expenses for the submarine cable to Sweden. Energinet will also save money by decommissioning the emergency
power facility currently maintained in stand-by mode. Over time, the connection of the Bornholm power grid to
the Energy Island, with its integrated links to Zealand, Germany, and potentially Poland, will lead to
financial savings for Energinet. This justifies the demand for state funding to cover the cost of the
connection. As a consumer representative for EWII, while I may not have direct influence over this decision, I

It is encouraging to see the shift in focus toward market collaborations rather than the technical debate
about an enclosed island versus platforms, which are economically very similar (as demonstrated by data from
Energinet, referenced in Zetland’s article). This shift is crucial because optimizing and financing the
transmission infrastructure is key to the project’s economics and success.  As part of Sweco’s advisory team,
it has been a privilege to contribute to the preparatory work on the North Sea Energy Island. It is promising
if this work resumes, allowing us to harness the enormous energy potential of the North Sea. This project
presents a unique opportunity for both Denmark and Europe to strengthen the green transition and ensure a
robust, sustainable energy infrastructure for the future.  I am excited to see how collaboration with Germany
can further advance the project and create synergies with other energy islands like Bornholm, while we
continue addressing the greatest technological challenges, including Power-to-X (PtX) and Carbon Capture and
Storage (CCS), to secure our energy security in an increasingly complex geopolitical landscape.

The Energy Island Bornholm project should be abandoned as the only responsible course of action. Instead,
supporters of the project are merely shifting the premise of the discussion, avoiding the necessary but
politically uncomfortable decisions. According to the Danish Energy Agency, the Energy Island Bornholm project
is far from profitable and will require an estimated 31.5 billion kroner in state subsidies. Although Denmark
will likely export significant amounts of the electricity produced—either directly or as green hydrogen—this
is not the kind of export success we want. It amounts to taxpayer-funded energy for Germany.  The argument for
improved Danish energy security remains somewhat valid by connecting Denmark and Germany with a power cable.
However, it makes no sense for this cable to span the longest distance between the two countries by going
through Bornholm. A much shorter and more cost-effective connection could be established via Lolland or
Zealand, saving substantial resources while achieving the same result.

historically large offshore wind tender in the North Sea, casting further uncertainty on the ambitions to
establish an energy island near Bornholm.  The failure of the North Sea wind tender leaves a billion-kroner
hole in the fund intended to finance the large-scale political plans for the energy island. Last year, a broad
political majority decided to allocate 17.6 billion kroner by 2049 to support the energy island, with
approximately half of the bill – 8.7 billion kroner – expected to be financed by revenues from the historic
offshore wind tender. However, these revenues are now uncertain as the first part of the tender ended without
any bidders.  According to several agreement parties, at least six billion kroner was expected to come from
the three wind farms in the North Sea. "The results from the North Sea parks mean that, unfortunately, there
is no contribution as expected to the financing of Energy Island Bornholm, and we must address this with the
agreement circle in the further process," says Climate, Energy, and Supply Minister Lars Aagaard in a written
comment.  The Conservative Party and the Liberal Alliance have also threatened to withdraw support for the
energy island. With the failed offshore wind tender in the North Sea, the latter is now very close to doing
so. For us, Energy Island Bornholm is more than green electricity. It is also about security policy. It helps
achieve European independence from countries we do not want to be dependent on, and that dimension is one of
the reasons we were very insistent on getting the island.  "I have followed the debate on the energy island
closely, but to make a final decision, I need an informed basis from the government that also considers the
security policy aspect. Green electricity can probably be obtained in many other ways, which are likely also
better economically, but for us, it is also about independence from Russian gas. So now it is up to the
government to provide some answers."  The Conservative Party has previously made it clear that there are
"limits to how much economy" the party is willing to invest. "It is not a straightforward project, but it is
certainly not abandoned. It delivers renewable energy, but it also provides supply security for Bornholm and
Zealand. Therefore, our starting point is that we will do what we can to realize it."  The Danish Energy
Agency recently postponed the offshore wind tender for Energy Island Bornholm due to a lack of clarification
on cables and stations.

We understand that the people of Bornholm want to reap the benefits that the Energy Island brings, both in
terms of consuming and producing green electricity on the island. That’s why I am pleased that our analysis
confirms it is technically feasible and, moreover, a good solution from a socioeconomic perspective.
According to Energinet, this solution could save approximately 1 billion kroner. The savings come from
eliminating the costs of supplying electricity via submarine cables if the Bornholm power grid is connected
directly to the Energy Island’s cables.   Additionally, Bornholm residents can expect relatively stable
electricity prices by connecting to the Energy Island’s power production.

The Danish Energy Agency has reported on the socioeconomic impact assessments for different configurations of
the Energy Island Bornholm under various scenarios. The Energy Island Bornholm project includes offshore wind
farms, a transformer station on Bornholm, and grid connections to Denmark and Germany. Despite considerable
uncertainty about future developments, the central socioeconomic estimates are negative across all scenarios,
ranging from -4 billion DKK to -17 billion DKK.  The project is also expected to require public subsidies
amounting to 31.5 billion DKK during the first approximately 20 years of the energy island's lifespan. Of
this, 17.6 billion DKK was politically approved in May 2023. This approved subsidy will be financed through
expected revenues from the auction of 6 GW offshore wind capacity (8.7 billion DKK), the Green Fund (4.9
billion DKK), and future fiscal space (4.0 billion DKK). An additional subsidy need of approximately 14
billion DKK has arisen due to the anticipated unprofitability of the offshore wind farms associated with the
energy island, and no concrete financing has yet been identified for this amount.  Given the negative
socioeconomic outlook, the Energy Island Bornholm project should be reconsidered. The socioeconomic assessment
does not include several effects that are difficult to quantify, such as energy security and potential Power-
to-X production. It is recommended that a comprehensive socioeconomic analysis be conducted, incorporating as
many effects as possible. If it cannot be demonstrated that the project yields a socioeconomic surplus, the
project should be abandoned.

It is important to reassess the socio-economic aspects of the Energy Island project. The current discussion is
based on outdated data from 2023, which is no longer relevant, and many factors are missing from the figures
being debated today. These factors include the value of energy security in Eastern Denmark, the anticipated
substantial financial support from the EU, and the competitive advantage for Danish businesses gained through
innovation in energy island technology.  The connection to Poland is especially critical. Bornholm is ideally
positioned to serve as a hub in the Baltic Sea, where large amounts of offshore wind energy can be harnessed
while linking European energy markets to improve overall energy stability and reduce costs across Europe.
However, the economic assessment of the Energy Island project should not be too narrowly focused. The market
should be allowed to determine the value of offshore wind energy south of Bornholm. Even small changes in the
assumptions used in the Danish Energy Agency’s calculations can significantly alter both the support
requirements and the socio-economic benefits of the project.

"There is nothing to say that the political support for the project is wavering, because the original promises
of profitability, better Danish security of supply and export adventure with hydrogen, produced by the large
amounts of excess flow from the island, have all fallen to the ground.   According to the Danish Energy
Agency, the project is far from being profitable, and the agency expects that it will require as much as DKK
31.5 billion in state aid. Although Denmark will probably end up exporting large quantities of the electricity
produced – directly or as green hydrogen – it is not the kind of export adventure you want, because it is de
facto tax-financed energy for the Germans.   What remains is the argument about better Danish security of
supply, which in its own way still holds by connecting Denmark and Germany with a power cable. But take out a
Danish map and give me a good reason why the cable should connect the two countries where the distance is
greatest, and not via, for example, Lolland or Zealand, where the distance is significantly smaller - and a
connection of course correspondingly cheaper.   However, the failed arguments have not made Climate, Energy

So now that batteries are on the way, the Energy Agency is expecting around 1 GW of storage capacity by 2030.
Denmark already has around 16 GW of installed batteries, which translates to about 800 MWh in Denmark.  When
you say "maybe only a few weeks a year", it's because those 'small holes' in the east are what we need to fill
when we're recharging our VE-building capacity. The Climate Council analyzed supply security last year and
concluded that in an "intensive weather year" we'll need to import electricity around 1000 times in 2030,
equivalent to about 6 weeks.  How we fill those gaps is still a topic of discussion. It's likely going to be a
combination of battery storage, flexibility on the demand side, flexible power plants, and imports. And yes,
even though power plants will only need to run for around 100 hours a year, they'll still be needed. Take
Kyndby Power Plant as an example, which is already standing by.  I'm surprised that people keep saying
'nuclear power would have been cheaper'. What experts in energy economics say, and what the market delivers
are two different things. If business cases for nuclear power were really so good, I'd expect more countries
to build them. Even China, which has all the prerequisites for cheap nuclear power, is building solar and wind
10 times faster.  As for when we'll have nuclear power in Denmark, if it's worth building, that's not going to
be as soon as 10 years. We're talking more like 2040. It's not just about building a power plant; we need the
right competencies, international agreements, and regulations before we can even start digging.  In Sweden,
where they already have nuclear power, the government started working on new nuclear power in 2022 with plans
to have it operational by 2035. In Norway, the Institute for Energy Technology estimates that you can get
nuclear power as soon as 2040 if you start now.  And finally, I think you should pay attention to what your
tariff covers and why it's increasing. The system tariff you pay to Energinet does include a component that
balances solar and wind power. But that's not the main reason for your increasing tariffs.

3. **Extremely expensive Power-to-X (PtX) production** on Bornholm compared to alternative energy sources.
Nuclear power, unlike these costly energy islands, can provide affordable and stable electricity and hydrogen
production. By situating nuclear power plants at existing combined heat and power plants, we can avoid further
industrializing natural areas.  Kärnfull Next is already developing nuclear power projects in Sweden and has
expressed interest in doing so in Denmark if the current ban on nuclear power is lifted. Nuclear power
eliminates the need for large-scale energy islands by offering stable electricity, district heating, and
hydrogen production.  Furthermore, many of our customers have already saved thousands of kroner by switching
to electricity contracts with 100% nuclear power, avoiding overpriced fixed-rate agreements or hidden fees. If
you are not yet a customer and would like a free price check on your electricity agreement, email us at

The transition of Samsø from being an energy consumer to an energy producer demonstrates the potential of
small communities to achieve energy independence. Prior to 1997, Samsø relied entirely on imported oil and
coal, and electricity was supplied through mainland grids. However, local entrepreneurship led to a bottom-up
approach, initiating the shift towards renewable energy, especially through the installation of wind turbines.
By 2005, Samsø produced more renewable energy than it consumed, achieving climate neutrality. This
transformation is particularly impressive given the island's small size, with only 22 villages and 4,000
residents. Samsø serves as an example of how green initiatives, such as renewable energy projects, are crucial
to creating a sustainable world, as emphasized by global sustainability efforts like the ENEP green economy
initiative. The island's success underlines the importance of social and technical entrepreneurship in
advancing sustainable energy solutions. This kind of entrepreneurial approach, combining both social and
technical expertise, is essential for improving the practice of sustainable design and development in energy
and resource efficiency.

We, the Danish Energy Agency, believe that the benefits of improved energy security from the Bornholm Energy
Island project are insufficient to offset the significant economic deficits associated with the project. Our
latest cost-benefit analysis reveals a societal economic deficit of 7 billion DKK, while the contribution of
the project to energy security is estimated at a mere 2.8 to 3.1 billion DKK. This discrepancy highlights the
limited ability of the project to justify its costs.

We, Energinet, have observed that concerns about energy supply inadequacy are less pressing than previously
estimated. Our analysis indicates a significant reduction in risks associated with capacity inadequacy in
neighboring countries. By 2034, Denmark’s power system is expected to be sufficiently connected to neighboring
countries, meaning additional interconnections, like the one from Bornholm, may not substantially improve
Denmark’s overall energy security.

The benefits of increased supply security are not enough to make the Energy Island Bornholm project
economically positive for society. According to an analysis referenced by Klimamonitor, the increased supply
security will be worth approximately DKK 150 million in 2032.  Although the analysis of supply security is not
comprehensive, the effects are so modest that it is hard to imagine it could turn a large negative into a
positive.  In October, the economic experts recommended dropping the Energy Island Bornholm project unless
positive economic benefits for society could be demonstrated. At the same time, they called for an analysis of
supply security, among other things. However, there is much evidence to suggest that this is not enough to
turn the project's economic outlook positive.  Climate economics assistant professor Peter Kjær Kruse-Andersen
also rightly points out that it is not so crucial whether the project's economic outlook just barely goes
above zero, as the project should be evaluated against the most obvious alternative. In this context, he finds
it very hard to see Energy Island Bornholm emerging as the winner.

Energinet supports Denmark’s investigation into establishing two energy islands, which will signify the
beginning of a new era for large-scale offshore wind power. These energy islands aim to facilitate the
integration of massive amounts of renewable energy into the grid, connecting offshore wind farms to multiple
countries, enhancing energy security, and contributing to the green transition in Europe.
